Impulsivity and emotion dysregulation have been identified as aspects of self-regulation that are highly relevant for individuals with eating pathology (Lavender et al., 2015) and were predictive of individuals who responded particularly well to JITAIs in our pilot trial (Presseller et al., 2022); these two constructs will be used as markers of self-regulation deficits at baseline.

It was tested cross-culturally, and a short version was created to clinically refer adults for an autism assessment. This study aimed to examine the properties of the Hebrew version of the Autism-Spectrum Quotient and to create a short version suitable for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.). Ninety-three clinically diagnosed autistic adults (24 females) aged 18–53, and 147 comparable controls (34 females) completed the Hebrew version of the Autism-Spectrum Quotient. Ten clinicians specializing in diagnosing autism in adults classified the Autism-Spectrum Quotient’s items according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) criteria. The Hebrew version of the Autism-Spectrum Quotient showed good internal consistency (Kuder-Richardson 20 = 0.90). Based on the prevalence of autism among clinically referred adults (70%), receiver operating characteristic analysis yielded area under the curve of 0.94. A cutoff of 21 demonstrated high sensitivity (0.90), specificity (0.76), positive predictive value (0.90), and negative predictive value (0.77). The short version of the Hebrew Autism-Spectrum Quotient included five social communication and five restricted, repetitive behavior items, which represented two social communication and two restricted, repetitive behavior criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.).

For these adults, a questionnaire that could assist in highlighting their need to seek diagnostic assessment is needed. The Autism-Spectrum Quotient is a self-report scale used to assess autistic traits. It was tested cross-culturally, and a short version was recommended to help identify adults who should be referred for an autism assessment. However, its relevance for the up-to-date diagnostic criteria, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.), has not been tested. This study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the Hebrew version of the Autism-Spectrum Quotient and to create a short version of the Hebrew Autism-Spectrum Quotient, based on items which map on to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) criteria. Ninety-three autistic adults (24 females), aged 18–51, clinically diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.), and 147 comparable controls (34 females) filled out the Hebrew version of the Autism-Spectrum Quotient. Ten clinicians who specialize in diagnosing autism in adults classified the Autism-Spectrum Quotient’s items according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) criteria. The short version of the Hebrew Autism-Spectrum Quotient comprised items that best differentiated between adults with and without autism, five items representing each of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) diagnostic domains.

Ten autistic adults consented to participate in narrative interviews which explored their life histories and pathways through homelessness. This article considers how participants experienced rough sleeping and sofa surfing before attempting to access hostels. It then examines how participants navigated support systems, arguing that barriers to accessing services perpetuated homelessness. Because of these barriers, some participants disengaged with services, preferring to sleep rough. The extent to which participants could be said to have ‘chosen’ homelessness is balanced with consideration of the lack of autonomy autistic adults are able to exercise over their lives.

However, little is known about the types of homelessness autistic people experience and what barriers autistic people face when trying to exit homelessness. This study involved gathering life stories of autistic people who had experienced homelessness. Ten autistic participants talked about their pathways through homelessness and the difficulties they had in accessing support. After first becoming homeless, participants tended to experience rough sleeping and sofa surfing. When participants approached housing and homelessness services, they were often told they were not eligible for support. This could happen when support workers were not aware of autism, or when autism was not considered ‘severe’ enough. Overcrowding, confrontation and lack of control over routine and environment were particular issues for participants when they entered homelessness hostels. Some participants chose to sleep on the streets rather than stay in environments which increased social anxiety and sensory difficulties. This study discusses ways in which homelessness and housing services can increase accessibility and improve engagement for autistic people. It is important to increase awareness of autism while understanding that autistic people who experience homelessness may have complex needs. In addition, services need to listen to autistic people with lived experience of homelessness to decide what changes will have the most impact. </jats:p></jats:sec>",list(id = "https://openalex.org/T10106", display_name = "Autism Spectrum Disorder Research", score = 0.999499976634979, subfield = list(id = "https://openalex.org/subfields/2805", display_name = "Cognitive Neuroscience"), field = list(id = "https://openalex.org/fields/28", display_name = "Neuroscience"), domain = list(id = "https://openalex.org/domains/1", display_name = "Life Sciences")),"University of Bristol, United Kingdom","University of Bristol, United Kingdom","University of Bristol, United Kingdom","https://openalex.org/I36234482","University of Bristol","education","GB","United Kingdom",NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","https://openalex.org/I36234482","University of Bristol","education","GB","United Kingdom",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","https://openalex.org/I36234482","University of Bristol","education","GB","United Kingdom",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","10/26/2025 21:07:58","EP","10.1177/13623613221105091","No, there is no statement that a pilot study was conducted","Refering to previous studies (e.g. ""a small pilot study yielded similar findings in children with ASD (Chong et al., 2021).""","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3 min"

We first conducted a pilot study to create the lists of criteria to be presented to participants across different domains. Please see Supplementary Materials for the Pilot Study. FROM THE SUPPLEMENTARY: Pilot study
We conducted a pilot study to create lists of criteria in four different domains to use in subsequent studies. We posted a study for 400 US participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk. In response, 438 participants (M¬age¬ = 34.98 years; 214 women, 113 men, one other, and 110 unreported) completed the study. We asked the participants to describe the criteria considered mandatory in their society for five different normative standards —a good employee, a good parent, the perfect job, the perfect house, and a beautiful woman. For example, in the employee domain, we asked participants, “Please write down the mandatory qualities an employee should possess to be considered a good employee in your society.” For each question, participants could list as many criteria as they wished.

To identify the most common criteria that participants mentioned for each domain, we submitted all criteria that participants listed in each domain to a latent semantic analysis (Landauer & Dumais, 1997). Specifically, for each domain, we entered all criteria listed by all participants on lsa.colorado.edu, which gave us a list of 100 criteria that were closest in meaning to all the criteria entered. Based on this analysis, we created lists of criteria for each domain to use in the subsequent studies.

Study 2b
Pre-Test. We conducted a pre-test to test the assumption that Singaporean consumers have broader normative standards for body washes compared with UK consumers. Given that women are the primary shoppers for household products both in the UK (Statista, 2014) and in Singapore (Nielsen, 2020), we sampled women in this study. We recruited 76 women students (Mage = 23.81) from a large public university in Singapore, and 80 women students from the UK through Prolific Academic™ (Mage = 21.53 years). We presented participants
with a list of 15 criteria that body washes can satisfy (e.g., be moisturizing, be cruelty-free, be dermatologist-approved), and asked them to select the benefits that were required for a body wash to be considered a good body wash. As in Study 1b, for each criterion, participants were asked to select either Yes or No. An independent samples t-test found that
students in Singapore indicated that a good body wash needs to meet more criteria (M = 10.74, 95% CI [10.24, 11.24], SD = 2.19) than did students in the UK (M = 9.91, 95% CI [9.32, 10.51], SD = 2.67, t(154) = 2.101, p =.037, Cohen’s d = 0.33).

Study 5a
In a separate pre-test conducted with the same participant pool, we ensured that all snacks were similarly well-liked (average liking ranged between 3.38 for Ritz™ Cheese Cracker Sandwiches™ to 4.87 for Oreo™ Cookies on a scale from 1 to 7, see Supplementary Materials).
From the SUPPLEMENTARY: 
A separate sample of 79 participants from the same pool as the original study rated how much they would like to receive a $50 hamper of each of the fourteen snacks (How much would you like to receive a gift hamper of [snack] worth $50?) on a 7-point scale from not at all to extremely. Average liking scores ranged between 3.38 to 4.87. Detailed results are reported in Table S7 below. 
As the snack options (e.g., Chips Ahoy, Ritz crackers, Doritos) were common in the US but might or might not be common in other countries, we excluded 12 participants who were not born in the US in the analysis reported in the manuscript. We conducted an additional regression without excluding non-US born participants from the dataset and found that the pattern of results did not change. Specifically, the number of attributes participants chose for a good snack (i.e., the breadth of normative standard) was positively correlated with the number of snack options they chose to view, despite the salient reduction in the hamper value with each additional option they chose to view (r = .14, 95% CI [-.004, .28], p = .057). 
We would also like to note that we paused data collection for about two weeks for Thanksgiving as students traveled out of state to visit their families.

Here, we demonstrated that this advantage incurs a cost in metacognitive accuracy (confidence), generating a cognition/metacognition trade-off. Using computational modeling, we found that integration to a fixed boundary results in less variability in evidence integration and thus reduces metacognitive accuracy, compared with a collapsing-boundary or a random-timer strategy. We examined how decision strategy affects metacognitive accuracy in three cross-domain experiments, in which 102 university students completed a free-response session (evidence terminated by the participant’s response) and an interrogation session (fixed number of evidence samples controlled by the experimenter). In both sessions, participants observed a sequence of evidence and reported their choice and confidence. As predicted, the interrogation protocol (preventing integration to boundary) enhanced metacognitive accuracy.

Drawing from the Black family stress and coping model, this mixed-methods study explored coping strategies utilized by parents of Black autistic children. Twenty-two parents completed the Ways of Coping Questionnaire and participated in semi-structured interviews. Using grounded theory methods, we conducted data collection and analyses simultaneously until we did not identify new themes. Our quantitative and qualitative results were generally aligned. We found that parents used an array of coping strategies, at times combining different methods, to address complex stressors. Parents also expressed the need for more social support from providers, as well as a desire for inclusive spaces where they could engage with other parents whom they felt could better relate to the stressors they encountered. Study findings also suggest that kinship support, church involvement, and collective socialization are key protective factors in Black communities. Therefore, understanding the role culture plays in the use and effectiveness of coping strategies is essential to improving healthcare and other systems of care. </jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Lay abstract</jats:title><jats:p> Parents of Black autistic children use several strategies to cope with daily stressors. These strategies include seeking social support, self-care, and optimism. We asked parents about their experiences receiving treatment services for their autistic child and how they reduce parenting stress. Twenty-two parents completed a coping survey and participated in individual interviews. Few studies have explored the experiences of Black families raising autistic children, and it’s important for healthcare and other systems of care to understand the role culture, race, and ethnicity play in the use of coping strategies. In our study, the majority of parents relied on social support to relieve stress and identified partners, family, and community members, as their most useful sources of support. Connecting with other parents of autistic children, through support groups and social media, also helped parents relieve stress. Parents discussed using self-care activities (e.g. church, exercising, listening to music) to cope with stressors. Several parents described how prayer and meditation helped them reframe stressful situations and gain more patience and appreciation for “what’s important.” The findings of this work demonstrate the need for professionals to have ongoing and deeper conversations about the ways in which parents deal with stressors. In particular, clinicians should leverage the strengths of Black families and promote strategies that are culturally informed and engaged. </jats:p></jats:sec>",list(id = "https://openalex.org/T11632", display_name = "Family and Disability Support Research", score = 1, subfield = list(id = "https://openalex.org/subfields/3203", display_name = "Clinical Psychology"), field = list(id = "https://openalex.org/fields/32", display_name = "Psychology"), domain = list(id = "https://openalex.org/domains/2", display_name = "Social Sciences")),"University of Maryland, Baltimore, United States","University of Maryland, Baltimore, United States","University of Maryland, Baltimore, United States","https://openalex.org/I126744593","University of Maryland, Baltimore","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","https://openalex.org/I126744593","University of Maryland, Baltimore","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","https://openalex.org/I126744593","University of Maryland, Baltimore","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","10/28/2025 8:01:02","EP","10.1177/13623613211070865","No, there is no statement that a pilot study was conducted","Keyword(s) in the references (e.g. ""J.

The present study examined how L1 experience moulds the initial processing of foreign (L2) tone during acquisition. In particular, we investigated whether learners were able to rapidly forge new neural memory traces for novel tonal words, which was tracked by recording learners’ ERP responses during two word acquisition sessions. We manipulated the degree of L1–L2 familiarity by comparing learners with a nontonal L1 (German) and a tonal L1 (Swedish) and by using tones that were similar (fall) or dissimilar (high, low, rise) to those occurring in Swedish. Our results indicate that a rapid, pre‐attentive memory trace build‐up for tone manifests in an early ERP component at ~50 ms but only at particularly high levels of L1–L2 similarity. Specifically, early processing was facilitated for an L2 tone that had a familiar pitch shape (fall) and word‐level function (inflection). This underlines the importance of these L1 properties for the early processing of L2 tone. In comparison, a later anterior negativity related to the processing of the tones’ grammatical content was unaffected by native language experience but was instead influenced by lexicality, pitch prominence, entrenchment, and successful learning. Behaviorally, learning effects emerged for all learners and tone types, regardless of L1–L2 familiarity or pitch prominence. Together, the findings suggest that while L1‐based facilitation effects occur, they mainly affect early processing stages and do not necessarily result in more successful L2 acquisition at behavioral level.</jats:p>",list(id = "https://openalex.org/T10465", display_name = "Neurobiology of Language and Bilingualism", score = 0.999599993228912, subfield = list(id = "https://openalex.org/subfields/2805", display_name = "Cognitive Neuroscience"), field = list(id = "https://openalex.org/fields/28", display_name = "Neuroscience"), domain = list(id = "https://openalex.org/domains/1", display_name = "Life Sciences")),"Lund University, Sweden","Lund University, Sweden","Lund University, Sweden","https://openalex.org/I187531555","Lund University","education","SE","Sweden",NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","https://openalex.org/I187531555","Lund University","education","SE","Sweden",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","https://openalex.org/I187531555","Lund University","education","SE","Sweden",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","10/29/2025 7:53:03","RS","10.1111/psyp.14042","Yes, the article states that there was a pilot study","","No","No, there is no statement about preregistration","1","Empirical study(ies)","Experimental study","The pitch movements had a naturalistic pitch span (40 Hz, 6 semitones) compared with the pitch movements of Swedish word tones and were easily distinguished by several native speakers of German and Swedish who piloted the experiment.","“Pilot*” (study, experiment, test or similar; piloting; piloted)","No","One pilot study reported in the article (single study)",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","The pitch movements had a naturalistic pitch span (40 Hz, 6 semitones) compared with the pitch movements of Swedish word tones and were easily distinguished by several native speakers of German and Swedish who piloted the experiment.","supplementary material available but not state pilot data specifically","Supplementary materials hosted by the journal","","No (GO TO NEXT SECTION)","","","No (GO TO NEXT SECTION)","","","Yes","The pitch movements had a naturalistic pitch span (40 Hz, 6 semitones) compared with the pitch movements of Swedish word tones and were easily distinguished by several native speakers of German and Swedish who piloted the experiment.","No, there is no statement about combining pilot data or results with the main study sample.",NA,"",NA,"Yes, the statement says that there is no conflict of interest","","No","","10 min"

                  <jats:p>Raw data are typically required to be processed to be ready for statistical analyses, and processing pipelines are often characterized by substantial heterogeneity. Here, we applied seven different approaches (trough‐to‐peak scoring by two different raters, script‐based baseline correction, Ledalab as well as four different models implemented in the software PsPM) to two fear conditioning data sets. Selection of the approaches included was guided by a systematic literature search by using fear conditioning research as a case example. Our approach can be viewed as a set of robustness analyses (i.e., same data subjected to different processing pipelines) aiming to investigate if and to what extent these different quantification approaches yield comparable results given the same data. To our knowledge, no formal framework for the evaluation of robustness analyses exists to date, but we may borrow some criteria from a framework suggested for the evaluation of “replicability” in general. Our results from seven different SCR quantification approaches applied to two data sets with different paradigms suggest that there may be no single approach that consistently yields larger effect sizes and could be universally considered “best.” Yet, at least some of the approaches employed show consistent effect sizes within each data set indicating comparability. Finally, we highlight substantial heterogeneity also within most quantification approaches and discuss implications and potential remedies.</jats:p>",list(id = "https://openalex.org/T10042", display_name = "Neural and Behavioral Psychology Studies", score = 0.959500014781952, subfield = list(id = "https://openalex.org/subfields/2805", display_name = "Cognitive Neuroscience"), field = list(id = "https://openalex.org/fields/28", display_name = "Neuroscience"), domain = list(id = "https://openalex.org/domains/1", display_name = "Life Sciences")),"Harvard University, United States","Universität Hamburg, Germany","Universität Hamburg, Germany","https://openalex.org/I136199984","Harvard University","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","https://openalex.org/I159176309","Universität Hamburg","education","DE","Germany",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","https://openalex.org/I159176309","Universität Hamburg","education","DE","Germany",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","10/29/2025 8:24:02","RS","10.1111/psyp.14058","the article has preliminary study as one of its references, it doesn't contain any pilot study","Keyword(s) in the references (e.g. ""J.

Here, we proposed that flexible, context-sensitive information search, rather than automatic responses, underlies these divergent effects of time pressure on prosociality. We demonstrated in two preregistered studies ( N = 304 adults from the United States and Canada; Prolific Academic) that different prosocial contexts (i.e., pure altruism vs. cooperation) have distinct effects on information search, driving people to prioritize information differently, particularly under time pressure. Furthermore, these information priorities subsequently influence prosocial choices, accounting for the different effects of time pressure in altruistic and cooperative contexts. These findings help explain existing inconsistencies in the field by emphasizing the role of dynamic context-sensitive information search during social decision-making, particularly under time pressure. </jats:p>",list(id = "https://openalex.org/T10646", display_name = "Experimental Behavioral Economics Studies", score = 0.99779999256134, subfield = list(id = "https://openalex.org/subfields/3311", display_name = "Safety Research"), field = list(id = "https://openalex.org/fields/33", display_name = "Social Sciences"), domain = list(id = "https://openalex.org/domains/2", display_name = "Social Sciences")),"University of Toronto, Canada","John Brown University, United States","University of Toronto, Canada","https://openalex.org/I185261750","University of Toronto","education","CA","Canada",NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","https://openalex.org/I175594653","John Brown University","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","https://openalex.org/I185261750","University of Toronto","education","CA","Canada",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","11/1/2025 19:39:29","CJG","10.1177/09567976221094782","Yes, the article states that there was a pilot study","","No","Yes, the article states that there is a preregistration","2","Empirical study(ies)","Experimental study","In this experiment, sample size was determined through bootstrapped power analyses (Strong & Alvarez, 2019) on pilot data collected with a smaller sample (N = 40).","“Pilot*” (study, experiment, test or similar; piloting; piloted)","No","One pilot study reported in the article (single study)","Sample size was determined through bootstrapped power analyses ... on pilot data collected with a smaller sample.",NA,"In this experiment, sample size was determined through bootstrapped power analyses (Strong & Alvarez, 2019) on pilot data collected with a smaller sample (N = 40).",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"No (GO TO NEXT SECTION)","","","No (GO TO NEXT SECTION)","","","No (GO TO NEXT SECTION)","","","No","","No, there is no statement about combining pilot data or results with the main study sample.","In this experiment, sample size was determined through bootstrapped power analyses (Strong & Alvarez, 2019) on pilot data collected with a smaller sample (N = 40).","","This research was supported by National Institute of Mental Health Grant 2P50 MH094258, Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) Insight Grant 435-2016-1274, and a Canada Research Chair award to C.

	  <jats:p>Already as infants humans are more fearful than our closest living primate relatives, the chimpanzees. Yet heightened fearfulness is mostly considered maladaptive, as it is thought to increase the risk of developing anxiety and depression. How can this human fear paradox be explained? The <jats:italic>fearful ape hypothesis</jats:italic> presented herein stipulates that, in the context of cooperative caregiving and provisioning unique to human great ape group life, heightened fearfulness was adaptive. This is because from early in ontogeny fearfulness expressed and perceived enhanced care-based responding and provisioning from, while concurrently increasing cooperation with, mothers and others. This explanation is based on a synthesis of existing research with human infants and children, demonstrating a link between fearfulness, greater sensitivity to and accuracy in detecting fear in others, and enhanced levels of cooperative behaviors.

We now believe this was a mistake, along with, we suspect, many colleagues in both the academic and policy communities. Results from such interventions have been disappointingly modest. But more importantly, they have guided many (though by no means all) behavioral scientists to frame policy problems in individual, not systemic, terms: To adopt what we call the “i-frame,” rather than the “s-frame.” The difference may be more consequential than i-frame advocates have realized, by deflecting attention and support away from s-frame policies. Indeed, highlighting the i-frame is a long-established objective of corporate opponents of concerted systemic action such as regulation and taxation. We illustrate our argument briefly for six policy problems, and in depth with the examples of climate change, obesity, retirement savings, and pollution from plastic waste. We argue that the most important way in which behavioral scientists can contribute to public policy is by employing their skills to develop and implement value-creating system-level change.</jats:p>",list(id = "https://openalex.org/T11542", display_name = "Behavioral Health and Interventions", score = 0.992500007152557, subfield = list(id = "https://openalex.org/subfields/3202", display_name = "Applied Psychology"), field = list(id = "https://openalex.org/fields/32", display_name = "Psychology"), domain = list(id = "https://openalex.org/domains/2", display_name = "Social Sciences")),"University of Warwick, United Kingdom","University of Warwick, United Kingdom","Decision Sciences (United States), United States","https://openalex.org/I39555362","University of Warwick","education","GB","United Kingdom",NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","https://openalex.org/I39555362","University of Warwick","education","GB","United Kingdom",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","https://openalex.org/I4210133369","Decision Sciences (United States)","company","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","11/1/2025 20:50:00","CJG","10.1017/S0140525X22002023","No, there is no statement that a pilot study was conducted","Keyword(s) in the references (e.g. ""J.

A laboratory‐based model of general anxiety disorder (GAD) using the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> challenge, has potential to be used to observe this relationship, potentially mimicking subjective, autonomic, and neuropsychological features of GAD. The current feasibility study used the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> challenge to explore postural control changes in healthy adults. It was predicted that during the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> condition, participants would show increased postural sway path length and decreased sway stability, compared with a normal air breathing condition. To assess this, heart and breathing rate, quiet standing postural sway path length, sway dynamic stability, and subjective measures of emotion were measured either before and after or during and after the inhalation conditions. Results demonstrated that CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> inhalation led to both an increase in sway path length and reduced sway stability compared to the air breathing conditions; the effect on sway path lasted after the inhalation of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> had ceased. Additionally, replication of HR and subjective measures of emotion were observed when comparing air and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> conditions. This provides experimental evidence that CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> inhalation can affect balance, suggestive of shared mechanisms between anxiety and balance performance, as well as indicating that the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> model of GAD is suitable to look at changes in balance performance in healthy adults.

We found that feedback had no effect on either perceptual or metacognitive sensitivity even after 7 days of training.

Sixty-nine providers attended a 1-day training workshop on the use of the Screening Tool for Autism in Toddlers.

Our prediction drew on two theoretical observations. First, feelings of regret frequently stem from comparing a chosen option with one’s belief about what the forgone alternative would have been. Second, when there are many alternatives to choose from under uncertainty, the perceived attractiveness of the almost-chosen alternative tends to exceed its reality. In four preregistered studies ( Ns = 800, 599, 150, and 197 adults), we found that participants predictably overestimated the forgone path, and this overestimation caused undue regret.

                    How do people learn about things that they have never perceived or inferred–like molecules, miracles or Marie‐Antoinette? For many thinkers, trust is the answer. Humans rely on communicated information, sometimes even when it contradicts blatantly their firsthand experience. We investigate the early ontogeny of this trust using a non‐verbal search paradigm in four main studies and three supplementary studies (
                    <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>
                     = 208). Infants and toddlers first see where a reward is, and then an informant communicates to them that it is in another location. We use this general experimental set‐up to assess the role of age, informants’ knowledge, cue's familiarity, and communicative context on trust in communicated information. Results reveal that infants and toddlers quickly trust familiar and novel communicative cues from well‐informed adults. When searching for the reward, they follow a well‐informed adults’ communicative cue, even when it contradicts what they just saw. Furthermore, infants are less likely to be guided by familiar and novel cues from poorly informed adults than toddlers. Thus, reliance on communication is calibrated during early childhood, up to the point of overriding evidence about informants’ knowledge. Moreover, toddlers trust much more strongly a novel cue when it is used in a communicative manner. Toddlers’ trust cannot be explained by mere compliance: it is highly reduced when communicated information is pitted against what participants currently see. Thus, humans’ strong tendency to rely on familiar and novel communicative cues emerges in infancy, and intensifies during the second year of life.

                  <jats:title>Objectives</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>Psychosocial late effects among survivors of pediatric brain tumors are common. For school-aged survivors, social skills deficits and isolation present a particular challenge. Social problem-solving is a social skill that is an important determinant of social outcomes and may yield a potential target for intervention.</jats:p>

               <jats:sec>
                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>School-aged youth (N = 65) 8–12 years of age (10.59 ± 1.36 years; 55.4% female, 86.2% white) who were 5.23 (SD = 2.44, range 2–10.9) years post-treatment for a brain tumor completed the Attributions and Coping Questionnaire, a measure of social problem-solving that uses vignettes to assess attribution of intent, subsequent emotional response, and imagined behavioral response to an interpersonal problem. Youth also completed self-reports of social functioning (PROMIS Peer Relationships, Self-Perception Profile). A caregiver completed additional measures of child social functioning (NIH Toolbox—Emotion Measures).</jats:p>

               <jats:sec>
                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>Survivors attributed unpleasant situations to accidental causes (neutral attribution) and responded in ways that prioritized the friendship (appeasement) or relied on adult intervention. Self-reported social functioning was higher among those who were less likely to avoid challenging social problem-solving situations.</jats:p>
               </jats:sec>
               <jats:sec>
                  <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>Findings identified characteristic social problem-solving approaches among survivors, including a tendency to attribute ambiguous situations to accidental causes and to request adult assistance and/or maintain social relationships. This may indicate a possible avenue for intervention, with a focus on increasing survivors’ understanding of the causes of potentially negative peer interactions and reducing their reliance on adults.</jats:p>

RF is also considered crucial for self-regulation for both parents and their children. We investigated the relationship between improvement in PRF after DUET group intervention (a RF-based intervention) and improvement in the parent–child interaction, child RF, and child adjustment, and we examined whether these improvements were distinct for children with different temperamental traits (e.g., effortful control). Eighty-four parents completed the DUET program and were assessed before and after the intervention. PRF was measured using observation (mind-mindedness) and a questionnaire. Statistical analysis included hierarchical regression and moderation of regression analysis. Results showed that improvement in the parent–child interaction, child RF, and child behavioral problems were related to improvement in PRF. Furthermore, we found that child temperament acted as a moderator in the link between PRF and child RF, supporting a vantage sensitivity model, meaning that it was the more sensitive children who benefitted the most as a result of the positive change in their parents’ RF.

                  <jats:p>An ideography is a general-purpose code made of pictures that do not encode language, which can be used autonomously – not just as a mnemonic prop – to encode information on a broad range of topics. Why are viable ideographies so hard to find? I contend that self-sufficient graphic codes need to be narrowly specialized. Writing systems are only an apparent exception: At their core, they are notations of a spoken language. Even if they also encode nonlinguistic information, they are useless to someone who lacks linguistic competence in the encoded language or a related one. The versatility of writing is thus vicarious: Writing borrows it from spoken language. Why is it so difficult to build a fully generalist graphic code? The most widespread answer points to a learnability problem. We possess specialized cognitive resources for learning spoken language, but lack them for graphic codes. I argue in favor of a different account: What is difficult about graphic codes is not so much learning or teaching them as getting every user to learn and teach the same code. This standardization problem does not affect spoken or signed languages as much.

(Authors, 2021). In the pilot study, the primary image set consisted of original images depicting diverse nature and urban scenes from Germany (100 each), as well as their phase-scrambled and line drawing version. From this larger set, we selected 60 images each for nature and urban environments. Stimuli selection was based on restorativeness (‘How restorative is this image for you?’; 5-point scale ranging from ‘not at all’ to ‘entirely’; original images) and recognition ratings (“Do you recognize objects in the image?”; 5-point scale ranging from ‘not at all’ to ‘entirely’; line drawings): We chose images with high (nature) or low (urban) restorativeness ratings, and low (urban) and high (nature) recognizability ratings for line drawings. The latter criterion led to a smaller difference in recognizability ratings for line drawings in the image set used in the current study (cf. Authors, 2021). The selected 60 original images per category differed in their restorativeness ratings, M nature = 4.33, SD nature = 0.87, M urban = 1.70, SD urban = 0.90, t(118) = 37.49, p < .001, d = 6.85.

Educational settings often contain contextual elements such as classroom decorations or visual aids to enhance student learning. Despite this, most research examining effects of contextual information on children's learning has only utilized lesson‐irrelevant stimuli. While this research has shown that increased looking to task‐irrelevant information hinders learning, the extent to which looking to lesson‐relevant information can benefit children's learning is unknown. We addressed this question by examining 3‐ to 5‐year‐old children's attention to and learning from lesson‐relevant contextual information. We recorded children's eye movements as they viewed video science lessons while lesson‐relevant and ‐irrelevant images appeared in the periphery. We assessed learning based on improvements in content knowledge following the video lessons and separately measured selective attention skills using the Track‐It task. Children overall spent more time looking at lesson‐relevant versus ‐irrelevant images, and those with more initial knowledge of the lesson topics or more advanced selective attention skills showed increased preferential looking to the relevant images. This increased preferential looking to lesson‐relevant images related to more effective learning during trials in which both relevant and irrelevant images were present. These results suggest that the effects of competing contextual information on early learning depend on the relationship between information content and task goals, as well as children's ability to actively select task‐relevant information from their environment.</jats:p>",list(id = "https://openalex.org/T11605", display_name = "Visual Attention and Saliency Detection", score = 0.991800010204315, subfield = list(id = "https://openalex.org/subfields/1707", display_name = "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"), field = list(id = "https://openalex.org/fields/17", display_name = "Computer Science"), domain = list(id = "https://openalex.org/domains/3", display_name = "Physical Sciences")),"Tulane University, United States","Tulane University, United States","Tulane University, United States","https://openalex.org/I114832834","Tulane University","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","https://openalex.org/I114832834","Tulane University","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","https://openalex.org/I114832834","Tulane University","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","11/7/2025 21:15:07","IP","10.1111/desc.13237","Yes, the article states that there was a pilot study","","No","No, there is no statement about preregistration","1","Empirical study(ies)","Experimental study","The knowledge assessments included six questions for each lesson topic (24 questions total; Table 1), which we selected based on a pilot study (see Supplementary Materials).

Participants were excluded if they had any diagnosed developmental, neurological, or visual conditions. These participants received a $10 gift card after completing the pilot study.
Participants answered 12 content knowledge questions about each lesson topic (How Frogs Grow, How Plants Grow, How Energy is Made, Where Animals Live). The procedure was identical to the baseline knowledge assessment described in the main experiment. During each trial participants heard a question spoken verbally while images representing the response choices appeared in each quadrant of the screen. Participants used a button box to respond by pressing a button that corresponded to one of the quadrants on the screen. Button presses were only accepted after participants had heard the entire question. Answer choices remained visible until the participant responded to the question or indicated a desire to skip the question. If participants failed to respond within 4500 ms after the question, the same question repeated every 4500 ms until the participant responded or indicated that they wanted to skip the question. We presented all questions for each lesson topic in a single block until children completed all questions. Topic order was counterbalanced across participants and question order was randomized within each topic.
We selected the six questions from each lesson topic with the lowest accuracy to use in the full experiment. Average accuracy for the selected questions was M = .45 (SD = .13), which was above chance responding (i.e., .25; p < .001) but below ceiling performance.

                    Neural oscillations, or brain rhythms, fluctuate in a manner reflecting ongoing behavior. Whether these fluctuations are instrumental or epiphenomenal to the behavior remains elusive. Attempts to experimentally manipulate neural oscillations exogenously using noninvasive brain stimulation have shown some promise, but difficulty with tailoring stimulation parameters to individuals has hindered progress in this field. We demonstrate here using electroencephalography (EEG) neurofeedback in a brain‐computer interface that human participants (
                    <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
                     = 44) learned over multiple sessions across a 6‐day period to self‐regulate their Beta rhythm (13–20 Hz), either up or down, over the right inferior frontal cortex. Training to downregulate Beta was more effective than training to upregulate Beta. The modulation was evident only during neurofeedback task performance but did not lead to offline alteration of Beta rhythm characteristics at rest, nor to changes in subsequent cognitive behavior. Likewise, a control group (
                    <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
                     = 38) who underwent training to up or downregulate the Alpha rhythm (8–12 Hz) did not exhibit behavioral changes. Although the right frontal Beta rhythm has been repeatedly implicated as a key component of the brain's inhibitory control system, the present data suggest that its manipulation offline prior to cognitive task performance does not result in behavioral change in healthy individuals. Whether this form of neurofeedback training could serve as a useful therapeutic target for disorders with dysfunctional inhibitory control as their basis remains to be tested in a context where performance is abnormally poor and neural dynamics are different.

There was also a significant main effect of Congruency, F(1, 76) = 20.91, p < .001, η2 = .353, with faster RTs to congruent (480 ms) compared to incongruent trials (488 ms).

                  <jats:title>Objective</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>Research suggests families whose infants are admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) experience elevated distress and may have pre-existing risk factors for maladjustment.

               <jats:sec>
                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>The sample included 171 mothers, who completed the PAT-NICU/CICU and other related measures within 2 weeks of their infant’s NICU admission at a level 4 unit within a large pediatric hospital. PAT-NICU/CICU scores were compared to a companion risk survey completed by NICU social workers. Test–retest reliability was assessed through repeated measures at 2-month follow-up.</jats:p>

               <jats:sec>
                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>Analyses suggest the PAT-NICU/CICU is effective in classifying psychosocial risk. This is supported by statistically significant correlations between the PAT-NICU/CICU and validated measures, in addition to elevated scores on concurrent measures by risk classification. Internal consistency, test–retest reliability, and acceptability for the PAT-NICU/CICU were satisfactory.</jats:p>

                  <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>This preliminary study demonstrates the validity, reliability, and acceptability of the PAT-NICU/CICU as a psychosocial screening tool to aid identification of families who may benefit from supportive services during NICU admission. This new measure is a more comprehensive tool that assesses a wide variety of risk factors and stress responses. However, future studies of this measure are needed with more diverse samples. Prompt screening of NICU parents may facilitate earlier linkage with appropriate levels of resources or intervention. This research is crucial in improving risk assessment and psychosocial care for families in the NICU.</jats:p>

Fifty-three expert providers rated their familiarity with 55 practices via an online Delphi poll. Exploratory structural equation modeling identified latent factors of familiarity, which were regressed onto provider and client variables to identify predictors. Four factors emerged: two approaches (cognitive and behavioral) and two strategies (engagement and accessibility). Cognitive approaches were associated with practicing outside school settings and treating clients without intellectual disability, behavioral approaches with practicing in schools and the disciplines of clinical psychology and behavior analysis, engagement strategies with practicing outside school settings, and accessibility strategies with more years in practice.

These providers may all be familiar with different types of intervention practices. However, research has not yet investigated patterns in expert providers’ familiarity with different practices nor how these patterns are related to the characteristics of providers (years in practice, academic discipline, setting) and the youth (age and intellectual disability) they typically support. A panel of 53 expert transdisciplinary providers rated their familiarity with 55 intervention practices (derived from research and expert nominations) via an online Delphi poll. Advanced statistical methods were used to identify types of intervention practices with which providers were familiar, which included two approaches (cognitive and behavioral) and two strategies (engagement and accessibility). Providers who practiced outside a school setting or treated clients without intellectual disability were more familiar with cognitive approaches. Clinical psychologists, behavior analysts, and school-based providers were more familiar with behavioral approaches. Providers practicing outside school settings were also more familiar with engagement strategies, and providers with more years in practice were more familiar with accessibility strategies. These results may help families and researchers to better anticipate how services may vary depending on the types of autism spectrum disorder providers seen and work to reduce disparities in care that may result. </jats:p></jats:sec>",list(id = "https://openalex.org/T10106", display_name = "Autism Spectrum Disorder Research", score = 1, subfield = list(id = "https://openalex.org/subfields/2805", display_name = "Cognitive Neuroscience"), field = list(id = "https://openalex.org/fields/28", display_name = "Neuroscience"), domain = list(id = "https://openalex.org/domains/1", display_name = "Life Sciences")),"Case Western Reserve University, United States","Case Western Reserve University, United States","University of British Columbia, Canada","https://openalex.org/I58956616","Case Western Reserve University","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","https://openalex.org/I58956616","Case Western Reserve University","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","https://openalex.org/I141945490","University of British Columbia","education","CA","Canada",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","11/14/2025 10:19:33","MBN","10.1177/13623613221100787","No, there is no statement that a pilot study was conducted","Keyword(s) in the references (e.g. ""J.

Overall, summary-statistics-based power analysis produced comparable results with the simulation-based power analysis. In the baseline condition, where cluster size and predictor variance are constant across clusters,
summary-statistics-based power analysis should show very similar power estimates with
simulation-based power analysis. In fact, we saw little discrepancy between the proposed and simulation-based methods in the average power and RMSEs (0.009 – 0.019). Given the general equivalence of the two approaches, the observed discrepancy is likely due to sampling errors in the simulation method. In fact, with 1,000 replications of the simulation-based power analysis, the standard error of a proportion estimate is maximally 0.016 (when true proportion is 0.50).
Critically, the results were robust even under conditions where predictor variance or cluster
size was varied across clusters. On average, both methods showed very similar power estimates, indicating that the proposed method is not biased in a systematic manner. RMSEs are mostly below 0.025, although the discrepancy was slightly larger when both L2 sample size cluster sizes were small and cluster size was varied (maximum = 0.030). In comparison to the baseline condition, RMSEs became larger only by 0 – 0.012. The robustness of the summary-statistics-based power analysis is consistent with the previous observations that cluster size heterogeneity does not have much impact on the statistical power estimates (e.g., van Breukelen et al., 2007).""
""The regression results are summarized in Table 4. To quantify the stability of parameter estimates, we also showed 95% CI (we corrected for the standard errors to take into account the fact that the same hypothetical data produced 9 pairs of power estimates). In
short, the results confirmed the robustness of the summary-statistics-based power analysis for both conditions. For L1 effect, overall discrepancy was very small (for relative power difference, -0.0002 and -0.0009; for absolute power difference, 0.0095 and 0.0098). For both relative difference and absolute difference, none of the predictors had strong effects on the discrepancy. For example, L1 effect size showed a negative effect of -0.0039 on the absolute difference in power in the variant cluster size condition. This means that the absolute power difference between the two power analysis methods increased by 0.00039 when (standardized) L1 effect size is smaller by 0.1.
For L2 effect, overall discrepancy was very small (for relative difference, -0.0008 and -
0.0013; for absolute difference, 0.0117 and 0.0124). None of the predictors had strong effects, although the effects seem to be slightly larger than the L1 effect overall. For example, random intercept SD had a positive effect of β = 0.0125 on relative power difference in the varied cluster variance condition. This means that summary-statistics-based power analysis tended to overestimate the statistical power by 0.00125 when random intercept SD increased by 0.1 (i.e. as large as the SD of errors).
For L12 effect, again, overall discrepancy was very small (for relative power difference,
0.0004 and -0.0004; for absolute power difference, 0.0119 and 0.0146). Most of the predictors did not have strong effects. The biggest effect seems to be that of the standardized L12 effect on relative power difference, which showed β= -0.0543 in the varied cluster size condition. This suggests that summary-statistics-based power analysis tends to underestimate power by 0.00543 in comparison to the simulation-based method when standardized L12 effect size increases by 0.1.""
""Results are reported in Table 5. Overall, despite the adverse condition, the proposed method showed reasonably good performance across different combinations of L2 sample size and cluster size, generally indicating the robustness of the summary-statistics-based power analysis. Of particular interest was the case when L2 sample size was small (i.e. 10). Our two major observations were as follows. First, on average, the proposed
method showed very similar statistical power to the simulation-based power analysis. Second, when L2 sample size was small, RMSE increased up to 0.034 (for L1 effect) to 0.048 (for L12 effect); This was a ~0.02-0.03 increase from the baseline model in Simulation 1. Together, these results demonstrate the robustness of the summary-statistics-based power analysis, even with strong violations of the assumption of equal cluster size, and with the modest violation of the assumption of equal predictor variance. The results also suggest that, when dealing with small sample size data, researchers need to bear in mind the possibility that a power estimate based on the proposed method may not be very accurate (i.e. it is better to oversample to be on a safe side).
In sum, these simulation studies demonstrate the reasonable robustness of the summary-
statistics-based power analysis even when critical statistical assumptions are violated. The
discrepancy between the proposed and simulation-based methods do not seem to be strongly impacted by the nature of the prior data (i.e., true parameters that define hypothetical pilot data). Even under the conditions of unequal within-cluster variance of predictor and cluster size (up to CsV = 0.55-0.56), power estimates by the proposed method did not systematically differ from those by the simulation-based method on average, although RMSE became slightly higher when sample size was small.""","No, there is no statement about combining pilot data or results with the main study sample.",NA,"","This research was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Numbers 18H01102; 18K18696 to KM), F.

Embedding strategies from an intervention like Joint Attention, Symbolic Play, Engagement, and Regulation into more traditional academic activities can help teachers target engagement and social communication throughout the school day. In the current study, we collaborated with special education preschool teachers to embed Joint Attention, Symbolic Play, Engagement, and Regulation strategies during small group time for moderate to severe disability students with autism spectrum disorder, 3–5 years of age. Compared to teachers implementing the standard preschool curriculum, teachers trained in Joint Attention, Symbolic Play, Engagement, and Regulation strategies effectively embedded these strategies in their small group activities, and their students were more likely to engage with peers during these activities. Supporting teachers to embed targeted strategies in academic activities can help them provide students more opportunities to engage with peers during the school day.

A pretest identified that interest in asking for help was correlated with expectations of how helpers would think and feel, but a series of scenarios, recalled experiences, and live interactions among adult participants in the United States (total N = 2,118) indicated that those needing help consistently underestimated others’ willingness to help, underestimated how positively helpers would feel, and overestimated how inconvenienced helpers would feel.

Such deaths are often abrupt with no satisfactory explanation. Suspected causes include cardiac QTc prolongation and, in turn, torsade de pointes (TdP). Psychotropic medications often prescribed to these patients are linked to QTc prolongation. AN is also presumed to cause heart failure due to malnutrition with increased susceptibility to QTc prolongation, and TdP, resulting in sudden cardiac death. Recent literature, however, is conflicting, and the likely cause of death may involve other cardiac abnormalities, such as low heart rate, abnormal heart rate variability, or increased QT dispersion. With an ongoing gap in research explaining the high mortality rate in AN, a compelling need to define the exact proximate causes of death in these patients remains. Because low serum potassium is the most common trigger for TdP, we postulate the early signal of sudden cardiac death, especially in patients with AN who purge, is hypokalemia.

Standard experimental practice is to design studies in which participants make judgments of targets who vary only on the social categories to which they belong. This is typically done under simplified decision landscapes and with untrained decision-makers. For example, to understand racial disparities in police shootings, researchers show pictures of armed and unarmed Black and White men to undergraduates and have them press “shoot” and “don't shoot” buttons. Having demonstrated categorical bias under these conditions, researchers then use such findings to claim that real-world disparities are also due to decision-maker bias. I describe three flaws inherent in this approach, flaws which undermine any direct contribution of experimental studies to explaining group disparities. First, the decision landscapes used in experimental studies lack crucial components present in actual decisions (<jats:italic>missing information flaw</jats:italic>). Second, categorical effects in experimental studies are not interpreted in light of other effects on outcomes, including behavioral differences across groups (<jats:italic>missing forces flaw</jats:italic>). Third, there is no systematic testing of whether the contingencies required to produce experimental effects are present in real-world decisions (<jats:italic>missing contingencies flaw</jats:italic>). I apply this analysis to three research topics to illustrate the scope of the problem. I discuss how this research tradition has skewed our understanding of the human mind within and beyond the discipline and how results from experimental studies of bias are generally misunderstood. I conclude by arguing that the current research tradition should be abandoned.</jats:p>",list(id = "https://openalex.org/T10314", display_name = "Social and Intergroup Psychology", score = 0.999499976634979, subfield = list(id = "https://openalex.org/subfields/3312", display_name = "Sociology and Political Science"), field = list(id = "https://openalex.org/fields/33", display_name = "Social Sciences"), domain = list(id = "https://openalex.org/domains/2", display_name = "Social Sciences")),"Michigan State University, United States","Indiana State University, United States","Indiana State University, United States","https://openalex.org/I87216513","Michigan State University","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","https://openalex.org/I86420138","Indiana State University","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","https://openalex.org/I86420138","Indiana State University","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","11/14/2025 16:42:51","ABa","10.1017/S0140525X21000017","No, there is no statement that a pilot study was conducted","Aviation context and keyword in the references","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1min45"

Specifically, we tested whether a higher moral obligations account could explain these divergent judgements of prejudice.

                  <jats:p>Fewer than one-third of childhood cancer survivors receive follow-up from an adult provider, and adolescent and young adults (AYAs) from structurally minoritized sociodemographic groups often face health disparities that can impact transition to adult-oriented care.

                  <jats:p>A total of 195 AYAs (aged 15–29) reported sociodemographic information, completed the Transition Readiness Inventory assessing positive beliefs/expectations and goals related to transition, and completed the Health Competence Beliefs Inventory assessing health perceptions, healthcare satisfaction, cognitive competence, and autonomy.

Previous research findings have suggested that encouraging autistic young people to explore autistic culture and spending time with autistic peers may be associated with more positive outcomes. Autism-specific peer support is a framework that may support this process. Thirteen participants (eight male/five female) completed semi-structured interviews, exploring the idea of autism-specific peer support within mainstream schools and the practicalities of how it may work within a school setting. Thematic analysis was applied, and three themes are reported: (1) neurodiversity and an ethos of inclusivity, (2) flexibility and (3) benefits and challenges of embedding peer support in the wider school community. The idea of autism-specific peer support for autistic pupils in mainstream secondary schools was generally positively received. Peer support may provide a unique opportunity for autistic pupils to interact in a natural, comfortable way; share useful strategies; and build their identities. Nevertheless, careful design, training and ongoing support, alongside awareness of the rights, needs and preferences of individual pupils involved are likely to be crucial in ensuring the success of any peer support programme. </jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Lay abstract</jats:title><jats:p> Autistic young people may struggle in mainstream schools and feel disconnected from their peers and their school. We know that autistic adults can benefit from spending time with other autistic people, but we don’t know if this is the case for younger autistic people. We conducted interviews with 13 autistic young adults in the United Kingdom who recently left mainstream schooling. We asked them if they would have been interested in being involved in autistic peer support when they were at school, and if so, what that peer support should look like. Results indicated that autistic young people were enthusiastic about the idea of peer support. They thought it was important that peer support was flexible to suit their needs at different times, as well as inclusive, positive, and embracing neurodiversity. They also discussed the potential benefits and difficulties of having a peer support system within a school setting. This adds to the growing body of research on the potential benefits of autistic-autistic interactions on autistic people’s well-being and sense of belonging. Findings can be used to help design pilot peer support projects in schools that can be tested to see how effective they are. </jats:p></jats:sec>",list(id = "https://openalex.org/T11632", display_name = "Family and Disability Support Research", score = 0.999800026416779, subfield = list(id = "https://openalex.org/subfields/3203", display_name = "Clinical Psychology"), field = list(id = "https://openalex.org/fields/32", display_name = "Psychology"), domain = list(id = "https://openalex.org/domains/2", display_name = "Social Sciences")),"University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom","University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom","Universities UK, United Kingdom","https://openalex.org/I98677209","University of Edinburgh","education","GB","United Kingdom",NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","https://openalex.org/I98677209","University of Edinburgh","education","GB","United Kingdom",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","https://openalex.org/I185658715","Universities UK","nonprofit","GB","United Kingdom",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","11/15/2025 21:00:50","IHM","10.1177/13623613221081189","No, there is no statement that a pilot study was conducted","Keyword(s) in the references (e.g. ""J.

                    <jats:p>Variation in how frequently caregivers engage with their children is associated with variation in children's later language outcomes. One explanation for this link is that caregivers use both verbal behaviors, such as labels, and non‐verbal behaviors, such as gestures, to help children establish reference to objects or events in the world. However, few studies have directly explored whether language outcomes are more strongly associated with referential behaviors that are expressed verbally, such as labels, or non‐verbally, such as gestures, or whether both are equally predictive. Here, we observed caregivers from 42 Spanish‐speaking families in the US engage with their 18‐month‐old children during 5‐min lab‐based, play sessions. Children's language processing speed and vocabulary size were assessed when children were 25 months. Bayesian model comparisons assessed the extent to which the frequencies of caregivers’ referential labels, referential gestures, or labels and gestures together, were more strongly associated with children's language outcomes than a model with caregiver total words, or overall talkativeness. The best‐fitting models showed that children who heard more referential labels at 18 months were faster in language processing and had larger vocabularies at 25 months. Models including gestures, or labels and gestures together, showed weaker fits to the data. Caregivers’ total words predicted children's language processing speed, but predicted vocabulary size less well. These results suggest that the frequency with which caregivers of 18‐month‐old children use referential labels, more so than referential gestures, is a critical feature of caregiver verbal engagement that contributes to language processing development and vocabulary growth.</jats:p>

We hereby present a dataset of specificity ratings collected from Italian native speakers on a set of around 1K Italian words, using the Best-Worst Scaling method. Through a series of correlation studies, we show that human-generated specificity ratings have low correlation coefficients with specificity metrics extracted automatically from WordNet, suggesting that WordNet does not reflect the hierarchical relations of category inclusion present in the speakers’ minds. Moreover, our ratings show low correlations with concreteness ratings, suggesting that the variables Specificity and Concreteness capture two separate aspects involved in abstraction and that specificity may need to be controlled for when investigating conceptual concreteness. Finally, through a series of regression studies we show that specificity explains a unique amount of variance in decision latencies (lexical decision task), suggesting that this variable has theoretical value.

We did the same with the support for gender diversification efforts scale in a separate regression analysis. We report the full results tables for each model in Table A2. We tested the form of each significant interaction to determine at what values of the moderator (endorsed value or gender diversity support) there was a significant positive relationship between trait gender stereotypicality and trait importance, indicating a masculine prototype, and a weak or non-significant relationship, indicating a balanced prototype.
Looking at the total sample, and consistent with the findings of Danbold & Bendersky (2020), we observed a significant positive relationship between trait gender stereotypicality and trait importance such that, on average, our respondents rated stereotypically masculine traits as more important than stereotypically feminine traits (B = 0.24, 95% Confidence Interval = [0.14, 0.34], p < .001, η2 = 0.02). This is consistent with our prediction that, at baseline, fire service professionals hold a masculine (as opposed to a balanced) professional prototype.
Endorsement of all of the three values we identified a priori as likely associated with holding a balanced prototype significantly moderated the association between trait gender stereotypicality and trait importance. As predicted, both the endorsement of inclusion (interaction term: B = -.25, [-0.36, -0.14], p < .001, η2p = 0.02) and the endorsement of tolerance (interaction term: B = -.17, [-0.26, -0.09], p < .001, η2p = 0.02) significantly attenuated the positive relationship between trait gender stereotypicality and trait importance. Also, as expected, the endorsement of tradition significantly moderated that association, but in the opposite direction (interaction term: B = .07, [0.01, 0.14], p = .022, η2p < 0.01). There was no significant interaction between trait gender stereotypicality and endorsement of any other value. In addition to these three values, support for gender diversity efforts significantly moderated the effect of trait gender stereotypicality on trait importance (interaction term: B = -0.16, [-0.22, -0.10], p < .001, η2p < 0.02).
To better understand the patterns of the significant interactions, we conducted a series of simple slope analyses to identify at which levels of value endorsement and support for gender diversity efforts participants held a balanced or a masculine prototype. Because most of the value endorsement ratings were positively skewed (the median scores for inclusion and tolerance were 6 and the median score for tradition was 5), we examined the slope of the relationship between trait gender stereotypicality and trait importance at more meaningful, specific levels of the moderators rather than at ± 1 SD from the mean (Dawson, 2014). Based on the scale anchors, we coded ratings of 3 as low, 5 as medium, and 7 as high. As can be seen in Figure A1, we observed a balanced prototype (i.e., a null relationship between trait gender stereotypicality and importance) when endorsement of inclusion was high (B = .03, SE = .07, p = .643), endorsement of tolerance was high (B = .06, SE = .07, p = .359), when support for gender diversity efforts was high (B = -.13, SE = .10, p = .162), and when endorsement of tradition was low (B = .09, SE = .08, p = .251). We observed a masculine prototype (i.e., a significant and positive relationship between trait gender stereotypicality and importance) when endorsement of inclusion was low (B = 1.04, SE = .18, p < .001), when endorsement of tolerance was low (B = .75, SE = .13, p < .001), when support for gender diversity efforts was low (B = .52, SE = .07, p < .001), and when endorsement of tradition was high (B = .40, SE = .08, p < .001).

A striking example of this is boundary extension, whereby observers mistakenly recall a view that extends beyond what was seen. However, not all visual memories extend in this way, which suggests that this process depends on specific scene properties. What factors determine when visual memories will include details that go beyond perceptual experience? Here, seven experiments ( N = 1,100 adults) explored whether spatial scale—specifically, perceived viewing distance—drives boundary extension. We created fake miniatures by exploiting tilt shift, a photographic effect that selectively reduces perceived distance while preserving other scene properties (e.g., making a distant railway appear like a model train). Fake miniaturization increased boundary extension for otherwise identical scenes: Participants who performed a scene-memory task misremembered fake-miniaturized views as farther away than they actually were. This effect went beyond low-level image changes and generalized to a completely different distance manipulation.

A gold standard for assessing anxiety-related behaviors in rodents is the elevated plus-maze (EPM), which was recently translated to humans using immersive virtual reality. Repeated behavioral testing is particularly interesting for clinical and pharmacological research in humans but could be limited by habituation effects. Here, we tested whether comparable strategies that are used in rodents (different environments and inter-trial interval of 28 days) are sufficient to avoid habituation or sensitization effects on the EPM, making it possible to perform repeated measurement of anxiety-related behavior in humans. Moreover, we developed two novel virtual environments for repeated testing to explore whether a scenario resembling the real world is superior to a video game-like EPM in terms of lifelike physiological, emotional, and behavioral responses. On a behavioral level, no significant differences but a high correlation between first and repeated exposure to the human EPM independent of EPM version were found. On a psychophysiological level, salivary alpha-amylase, skin-conductance, and respiratory frequency increased at first and second exposure independent of EPM version. However, at repeated exposure, skin-conductance and heart rate showed indicators for anticipatory anxiety and a small sensitization effect, while no effect of real-world resemblance on these physiological measures was found. This was also reflected in slightly higher subjective anxiety levels at second exposure, although subjective anxiety still correlated strongly between first and second exposure.

Further, because observed time course and peak amplitude of ERP grand averages and thus findings on SNR, stability, and internal consistency may depend on preprocessing method, we employed a custom and a standardized preprocessing pipeline and compared findings across those. Using our custom pipeline, reward anticipation components were stable by the 40th trial, achieved acceptable internal consistency by the 19th, and all (but the stimulus‐preceding negativity [SPN]) achieved acceptable SNR by the 41st trial. Initial response to reward components were stable by the 20th trial and achieved acceptable internal consistency by the 11th and acceptable SNR by the 45th trial. Difference scores had worse psychometric properties than parent measures. Time course and peak amplitudes of ERPs and thus results on SNR, stability, and internal consistency were comparable across preprocessing pipelines. In case of reward anticipation ERPs examined here, 41 trials (+4 artifacted and removed) and, in case of reward response ERPs, 45 trials (+5 artifacted) yielded stable and internally consistent estimates with acceptable SNR.

                  <jats:p>Youth and adolescents (N = 34) with newly diagnosed T1D completed distress and resilience measures at baseline and 3 months following diagnosis. Using multilevel modeling, we predicted A1C trajectories up to 3 years following diagnosis.</jats:p>

Females mainly exhibited higher amygdala activation during extinction memory recall to the extinguished conditioned stimulus and also while responding to the unconditioned stimulus (presentation of the shock) during threat conditioning. Whole-brain functional connectivity analyses revealed that females showed increased connectivity across multiple networks including visual, ventral attention, and somatomotor networks during late extinction learning. At the psychophysiological level, a sex difference was only observed during shock delivery, with males exhibiting higher unconditioned responses relative to females. Our findings point to minimal to no sex differences in the expression of conditioned responses during acquisition and extinction of such responses. Functional MRI findings, however, show some distinct functional activations and connectivities between the sexes. These data suggest that males and females might use different neural mechanisms, mainly related to cognitive processing, to achieve comparable levels of acquired conditioned responses to threating cues.</jats:p>",list(id = "https://openalex.org/T10448", display_name = "Memory and Neural Mechanisms", score = 0.999599993228912, subfield = list(id = "https://openalex.org/subfields/2805", display_name = "Cognitive Neuroscience"), field = list(id = "https://openalex.org/fields/28", display_name = "Neuroscience"), domain = list(id = "https://openalex.org/domains/1", display_name = "Life Sciences")),"New York University, United States","The University of Texas Health Science Center, United States","The University of Texas Health Science Center, United States","https://openalex.org/I57206974","New York University","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","https://openalex.org/I4210159031","The University of Texas Health Science Center","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","https://openalex.org/I4210159031","The University of Texas Health Science Center","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","11/17/2025 14:34:24","JB","10.1101/lm.053521.121","No, there is no statement that a pilot study was conducted","Keyword(s) in the references (e.g. ""J.

Earlier studies suggest that a positive affective state characterized by the feeling of safety could reduce an individual’s reward sensitivity. A promising technique to establish a feeling of safety on demand is to utilize post‐hypnotic suggestions. We hypothesized that the feeling of safety elicited by post‐hypnotic suggestions reduces neural signals of reward sensitivity. To test our predictions, we hypnotized 24 highly suggestible participants, suggested them to feel safe and coupled this feeling of safety to a post‐hypnotic trigger that reactivates the feeling of safety outside the hypnotic state. Participants then played a risk game both in a safety condition using the post‐hypnotic safety trigger and in a control condition using a neutral trigger. Simultaneously, we recorded their EEG. Participants reported significantly higher ratings of safety in the safety condition compared to the control condition. Even several weeks after the main experimental session, the post‐hypnotic safety trigger still elicited a significantly stronger feeling of safety compared to the control condition. Moreover, the Reward Positivity (RewP) was significantly reduced in the safety condition. As the RewP amplitude has been proposed as a psychophysiological marker for reward sensitivity, we conclude that the suggestion of safety by post‐hypnotic suggestions turns participants into a quiescence motivational state that makes them less reward sensitive. Therefore, we discuss implications of the post‐hypnotic safety trigger for the treatment of disorders associated with increased reward sensitivity such as addictive behaviors.</jats:p>",list(id = "https://openalex.org/T10042", display_name = "Neural and Behavioral Psychology Studies", score = 0.999599993228912, subfield = list(id = "https://openalex.org/subfields/2805", display_name = "Cognitive Neuroscience"), field = list(id = "https://openalex.org/fields/28", display_name = "Neuroscience"), domain = list(id = "https://openalex.org/domains/1", display_name = "Life Sciences")),NA,"Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Germany","University Hospital Regensburg, Germany",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"https://openalex.org/I39343248","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin","education","DE","Germany",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","https://openalex.org/I3129555431","University Hospital Regensburg","healthcare","DE","Germany",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","11/17/2025 15:04:24","JB","10.1111/psyp.14015","No, there is no statement that a pilot study was conducted","Keyword(s) in the references (e.g. ""J.

Approach, attentional, and association biases towards valenced stimuli were repeatedly measured at five different time points in a sample of 79 healthy young adults. Two different devices were used for assessment: a personal computer (PC) and a touchscreen-based tablet. Reliability estimates included internal consistency and temporal stability. Validity was inferred from convergence across different behavioral tasks and correlations between bias scores and self-reported psychological traits. Reliability ranged widely amongst tasks, assessment devices, and measurement time points. While the dot-probe-task appeared to be completely unreliable, bias scores obtained from the PC-based version of the AAT and both (PC and touchscreen) versions of the IAT showed moderate reliability.

Although some age differences emerged, the majority of participants in all age groups claimed familiarity with involuntary memories and provided examples from their own experience. Moreover, the self-reported frequency of IAMs and mind-pops was high, and reported IAMs usually referred to incidental environmental triggers, whereas reported mind-pops did not. This age invariance highlights the ubiquity of involuntary memories across development and opens up interesting avenues for developmental research on involuntary memories and other spontaneous phenomena (e.g., mind-wandering, future thinking).</jats:p>",list(id = "https://openalex.org/T11983", display_name = "Identity, Memory, and Therapy", score = 0.999400019645691, subfield = list(id = "https://openalex.org/subfields/3204", display_name = "Developmental and Educational Psychology"), field = list(id = "https://openalex.org/fields/32", display_name = "Psychology"), domain = list(id = "https://openalex.org/domains/2", display_name = "Social Sciences")),"University of Hertfordshire, United Kingdom","University of Hertfordshire, United Kingdom","Anglia Ruskin University, United Kingdom","https://openalex.org/I141584323","University of Hertfordshire","education","GB","United Kingdom",NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","https://openalex.org/I141584323","University of Hertfordshire","education","GB","United Kingdom",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","https://openalex.org/I51216347","Anglia Ruskin University","education","GB","United Kingdom",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","11/20/2025 4:20:09","YC","DOI: 10.1111/cdev.13794","Yes, the article states that there was a pilot study","","No","No, there is no statement about preregistration","1","Empirical study(ies)","Qualitative study","The choice of age groups and the interview method was based on the results of extensive piloting of the method with children aged 7–8 (n = 20), 9–10 (n = 25), 11–13 (n = 19), and 14–15 years (n = 17) and a group of undergraduate students (n = 47).

Generalised estimating equations and structured equation modelling was used to understand changes over time, differences between groups and bidirectional relationships. As expected, children with ASD, ADHD or ASD + ADHD had higher EBPs than children without, and their mothers had higher levels of psychological distress across most time points, but with differing trajectories. Mothers of children with ASD (with or without ADHD) showed increasing psychological distress over time, while mothers of children with ADHD had reducing distress.

This study reports the perspectives of early intervention providers who learned to use Project ImPACT for Toddlers on whether the intervention was a good fit for their practice and easy to use. The study also examines how many agencies are using Project ImPACT for Toddlers and how many families have received the intervention in the community. The goal of the study is to inform the continued use of Project ImPACT for Toddlers in the community and support offering the intervention in other regions. Participants include 38 community providers who participated in a training study of Project ImPACT for Toddlers and completed a survey and semi-structured interview after approximately 3 months of using Project ImPACT for Toddlers with families. Participants perceived the training model as acceptable and appropriate, and identified the group-based model of training, comprehensive materials, and agency support as strengths of the approach. Survey findings complemented the results from the interviews. Data indicate an increasing number of agencies and families accessing Project ImPACT for Toddlers. Efforts to expand evidence-based intervention in early intervention should continue to build upon the model used for Project ImPACT for Toddlers. </jats:p></jats:sec>",list(id = "https://openalex.org/T11632", display_name = "Family and Disability Support Research", score = 0.998300015926361, subfield = list(id = "https://openalex.org/subfields/3203", display_name = "Clinical Psychology"), field = list(id = "https://openalex.org/fields/32", display_name = "Psychology"), domain = list(id = "https://openalex.org/domains/2", display_name = "Social Sciences")),"San Diego State University, United States","American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, United States","University of California System, United States","https://openalex.org/I26538001","San Diego State University","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","https://openalex.org/I185990448","American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry","nonprofit","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","https://openalex.org/I2803209242","University of California System","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","11/21/2025 10:48:08","JH","10.1177/13623613211065535","Yes, the article states that there was a pilot study","","No","No, there is no statement about preregistration","1","Empirical study(ies)","Quantitative observational study","After selection, however, initial pilot testing of Project ImPACT by providers and families in the community revealed several areas of needed adaptations to improve its fit for toddlers and the agencies that serve them in service of maximizing community sustainment and uptake.

                    <jats:p>South Africa's rates of psychiatric morbidity are among the highest in sub‐Saharan Africa and are foregrounded by the country's long history of political violence during apartheid. Growing evidence suggests that in utero stress exposure is a potent developmental risk factor for future mental illness risk, yet the extent to which the psychiatric effects of prenatal stress impact the next generation are unknown. We evaluate the intergenerational effects of prenatal stress experienced during apartheid on psychiatric morbidity among children at ages 17–18 and also assess the moderating effects of maternal age, social support, and past household adversity.</jats:p>

                    <jats:p>Participants come from Birth‐to‐Twenty, a longitudinal birth cohort study in Soweto‐Johannesburg, South Africa's largest peri‐urban township which was the epicentre of violent repression and resistance during the final years of the apartheid regime. Pregnant women were prospectively enrolled in 1990 and completed questionnaires assessing social experiences, and their children's psychiatric morbidity were assessed at ages 17–18.</jats:p>

                    <jats:p>Full data were available from 304 mother–child pairs in 2007–8. Maternal prenatal stress in 1990 was not directly associated greater psychiatric morbidity during at ages 17–18. Maternal age and past household adversity moderated the intergenerational mental health effects of prenatal stress such that children born to younger mothers and late adolescent/young adult children experiencing greater household adversity exhibited worse psychiatric morbidity at ages 17–18. Social support did not buffer against the long‐term psychiatric impacts of prenatal stress.</jats:p>

                    <jats:p>Greater prenatal stress from apartheid predicted adverse psychiatric outcomes among children born to younger mothers and adolescents/young adults who experienced greater concurrent stress. Our findings suggest that prenatal stress may affect adolescent mental health, have stress‐sensitising effects, and represent possible intergenerational effects of trauma experienced under apartheid in this sample.</jats:p>

However, the empirical support for these hypotheses is limited by inconsistencies in the way socialness has been defined and measured. To further advance theory, the field must establish a clearer working definition, and research efforts could be facilitated by the availability of an extensive set of socialness ratings for individual concepts. Therefore, in the current work, we employed a novel and inclusive definition to test the extent to which socialness is reliably perceived as a broad construct, and we report socialness norms for over 8000 English words, including nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Our inclusive socialness measure shows good reliability and validity, and our analyses suggest that the socialness ratings capture aspects of word meaning which are distinct to those measured by other pertinent semantic constructs, including concreteness and emotional valence. Finally, in a series of regression analyses, we show for the first time that the socialness of a word's meaning explains unique variance in participant performance on lexical tasks. Our dataset of socialness norms has considerable item overlap with those used in both other lexical/semantic norms and in available behavioural mega-studies. They can help target testable predictions about brain and behaviour derived from multiple representation theories and neurobiological accounts of social semantics.</jats:p>",list(id = "https://openalex.org/T11431", display_name = "Action Observation and Synchronization", score = 0.999100029468536, subfield = list(id = "https://openalex.org/subfields/3207", display_name = "Social Psychology"), field = list(id = "https://openalex.org/fields/32", display_name = "Psychology"), domain = list(id = "https://openalex.org/domains/2", display_name = "Social Sciences")),"Bangor University, United Kingdom","Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital, Canada","Bangor University, United Kingdom","https://openalex.org/I161548249","Bangor University","education","GB","United Kingdom",NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","https://openalex.org/I1292859797","Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital","healthcare","CA","Canada",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","https://openalex.org/I161548249","Bangor University","education","GB","United Kingdom",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","11/21/2025 12:05:06","JH","10.3758/s13428-022-01810-x","Yes, the article states that there was a pilot study","","No","The article states, the study was not pre-registered.","1","Empirical study(ies)","Quantitative observational study","We used 30 of the 8948 words as a set of control items which were to be presented to every participant and used during the data cleaning process (see below).

participants provided explanations that were consistent with our inclusive socialness
definition (e.g.: “Socialness describes anything related to people, for instance their
interactions, ways of describing people, relationships, social places/event, social beliefs,
etc.”; “relation to people and society”). Interestingly, many participants focused their
explanations on the link between the word’s meaning and social interactions (e.g., “Of, or
relating to, the interaction of individuals. That which pertains to people interacting.”; “The
socialness referred to how likely it was that the words were associated with social concepts
by involving social interactions, by influencing social interactions, and by representing those
and the values of those in social encounters.”). 

A Pearson’s Chi-square test of independence suggested that self-reported
understanding of the instructions did not depend on the version of the instructions χ² (2, N =

for the two instruction versions (r = 0.93, p <.001, R

comparable for the two versions, with a mean Spearman-Brown corrected split-half reliability
