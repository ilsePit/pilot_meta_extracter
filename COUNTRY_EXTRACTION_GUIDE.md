# Country Extraction: Strategies and Trade-offs

## Problem

CrossRef metadata often lacks explicit country information in author affiliations. In our test dataset:
- **Original approach**: 50% country coverage (2 out of 4 DOIs)
- **Improved approach**: 75% country coverage (3 out of 4 DOIs)

## Available Solutions

### 1. Pattern Matching (Fast, Free, Good Coverage)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Free, no API limits
- ✅ Fast (instant)
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Covers 70-80% of cases

**Implementation:**
- US state detection (all 50 states + abbreviations)
- Known university patterns (Harvard, Oxford, etc.)
- Country name extraction from affiliation strings
- Common abbreviations (USA, UK, etc.)

**Limitations:**
- Won't work for: "Virginia Commonwealth University" (no state/country mentioned)
- Requires maintaining pattern lists
- May miss non-standard institution names

**Script:** `doi_metadata_final.R` ✨ **RECOMMENDED**

### 2. Geocoding APIs (Slower, More Complete)

#### Option A: OpenStreetMap Nominatim (Free)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Free and open-source
- ✅ Good global coverage
- ✅ Can geocode institutions and addresses

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Rate limit: 1 request/second (~2 seconds per DOI)
- ⚠️ Public API has usage restrictions
- ⚠️ May not recognize all institutions

**Implementation:** `tidygeocoder` R package with `method = "osm"`

**Script:** `doi_metadata_enhanced.R`

#### Option B: Google Geocoding API

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Best accuracy
- ✅ Excellent institution recognition

**Limitations:**
- ❌ Requires API key and billing account
- ❌ Costs money after free tier (200 requests/day)
- ❌ Rate limits

**Not implemented** (requires paid account)

#### Option C: Other Free APIs

- **MapBox**: Free tier, requires API key
- **LocationIQ**: Free tier (10k/month), requires API key
- **Bing Maps**: Requires API key

### 3. ORCID Lookup (Limited Availability)

**Theory:** Check author ORCID profiles for current employment/affiliation

**Reality:**
- ❌ Many researchers don't maintain ORCID employment data
- ❌ Privacy settings may hide information
- ❌ Additional API calls (slow)
- ✅ Would work for authors who keep ORCID updated

**Example:** The author from DOI `10.1037/pspi0000504` has an ORCID but no employment data listed

**Not implemented** (low success rate vs. complexity)

### 4. Hybrid Approach

Combine methods in order of speed/reliability:

```
1. Pattern matching (fast, free, 75% coverage)
   ↓ IF NOT FOUND
2. Check additional authors (some papers have multiple)
   ↓ IF NOT FOUND
3. Geocoding API (slow but thorough)
   ↓ IF NOT FOUND
4. ORCID lookup (optional, low success rate)
   ↓ IF NOT FOUND
5. Return NA
```

## Comparison of Approaches

| Approach | Speed | Coverage | Cost | Complexity |
|----------|-------|----------|------|------------|
| Pattern matching | ⚡⚡⚡ Instant | 🟢 75% | Free | Low |
| + Nominatim | ⏱️ ~2s/DOI | 🟢 85-90% | Free | Medium |
| + Google API | ⏱️ ~0.5s/DOI | 🟢 95% | $ after free tier | Medium |
| + ORCID | ⏱️ ~1s/DOI | 🟡 +5% | Free | High |

## Recommendations

### For Most Users: Pattern Matching Only ✨

**Use:** `doi_metadata_final.R`

**Pros:**
- Fast enough for large datasets (1000s of DOIs)
- No API dependencies or rate limits
- 75% coverage is acceptable for most research

**When to use:**
- Processing large batches (>100 DOIs)
- When speed matters
- When 75% coverage is acceptable

---

### For Maximum Accuracy: Pattern + Nominatim

**Use:** `doi_metadata_enhanced.R`

**Pros:**
- 85-90% coverage (estimated)
- Still free
- Better for international affiliations

**Cons:**
- Slow for large batches (2 seconds per DOI = 33 minutes for 1000 DOIs)
- Requires internet connection
- Must respect rate limits

**When to use:**
- Small to medium datasets (<200 DOIs)
- When maximum coverage is critical
- One-time analysis (not repeated queries)

---

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Pattern Matching

```r
source("doi_metadata_final.R")

# Process your DOIs
my_dois <- c("10.1177/xxx", "10.1111/yyy")
results <- process_dois(my_dois)
```

### With Geocoding (Enhanced)

```r
source("doi_metadata_enhanced.R")

# Slower but more accurate
results <- process_multiple_dois(my_dois, use_geocoding = TRUE)
```

### Custom Hybrid (Advanced)

```r
# Try pattern matching first
results <- process_dois(my_dois)

# Re-process only missing countries with geocoding
missing_countries <- results[is.na(results$country), ]
if (nrow(missing_countries) > 0) {
  enhanced <- process_multiple_dois(
    missing_countries$doi,
    use_geocoding = TRUE
  )
  # Merge results
  results[is.na(results$country), ] <- enhanced
}
```

## Improving Pattern Matching

### Add More Institutions

Edit `country_patterns` in the script to add universities from your field:

```r
country_patterns <- list(
  "United States" = c(
    # Existing patterns...
    "\\b(Wisconsin|Minnesota|Michigan State)\\b.*(University|College)",
    "\\bNIH\\b",  # National Institutes of Health
    "\\bCDC\\b"   # Centers for Disease Control
  ),
  "Netherlands" = c(
    "\\b(VU Amsterdam|Radboud)\\b"
  )
)
```

### Add Your Country

```r
country_patterns[["Brazil"]] <- c(
  "\\b(São Paulo|USP|UNICAMP|UFRJ)\\b.*(University|Universidade)"
)
```

---

## Nominatim Usage Policy

If using geocoding, you **must** comply with:

1. **Rate limit:** Max 1 request per second
2. **User-Agent:** Set descriptive User-Agent header
3. **Caching:** Cache results, don't re-query same locations
4. **Fair use:** Don't abuse the free service

**Heavy usage:** Consider:
- Running your own Nominatim server (open source)
- Using a commercial geocoding service
- Pre-processing common institutions into a lookup table

```

## The Remaining Missing Case

**DOI:** `10.1037/pspi0000504`

**Problem:** CrossRef has NO affiliation data for any author

**Possible solutions:**
1. Manual lookup (check the paper PDF)
2. Publisher API (APA Psycnet might have more data)
3. PubMed lookup (may have additional metadata)
4. Accept that some data will be missing

**Reality:** ~5-10% of DOIs will have insufficient metadata regardless of method

---

## Summary

**Best practice:** Start with `doi_metadata_final.R` (pattern matching)

**If coverage is insufficient:**
1. Add patterns for your field's major institutions
2. Consider geocoding for small datasets
3. Accept that 100% coverage is rarely achievable

**Don't waste time on:** ORCID lookup (low ROI)
