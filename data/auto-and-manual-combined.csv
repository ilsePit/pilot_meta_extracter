We first conducted a pilot study to create the lists of criteria to be presented to participants across different domains. Please see Supplementary Materials for the Pilot Study. FROM THE SUPPLEMENTARY: Pilot study
We conducted a pilot study to create lists of criteria in four different domains to use in subsequent studies. We posted a study for 400 US participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk. In response, 438 participants (M¬age¬ = 34.98 years; 214 women, 113 men, one other, and 110 unreported) completed the study. We asked the participants to describe the criteria considered mandatory in their society for five different normative standards —a good employee, a good parent, the perfect job, the perfect house, and a beautiful woman. For example, in the employee domain, we asked participants, “Please write down the mandatory qualities an employee should possess to be considered a good employee in your society.” For each question, participants could list as many criteria as they wished.

To identify the most common criteria that participants mentioned for each domain, we submitted all criteria that participants listed in each domain to a latent semantic analysis (Landauer & Dumais, 1997). Specifically, for each domain, we entered all criteria listed by all participants on lsa.colorado.edu, which gave us a list of 100 criteria that were closest in meaning to all the criteria entered. Based on this analysis, we created lists of criteria for each domain to use in the subsequent studies.

Study 2b
Pre-Test. We conducted a pre-test to test the assumption that Singaporean consumers have broader normative standards for body washes compared with UK consumers. Given that women are the primary shoppers for household products both in the UK (Statista, 2014) and in Singapore (Nielsen, 2020), we sampled women in this study. We recruited 76 women students (Mage = 23.81) from a large public university in Singapore, and 80 women students from the UK through Prolific Academic™ (Mage = 21.53 years). We presented participants
with a list of 15 criteria that body washes can satisfy (e.g., be moisturizing, be cruelty-free, be dermatologist-approved), and asked them to select the benefits that were required for a body wash to be considered a good body wash. As in Study 1b, for each criterion, participants were asked to select either Yes or No. An independent samples t-test found that
students in Singapore indicated that a good body wash needs to meet more criteria (M = 10.74, 95% CI [10.24, 11.24], SD = 2.19) than did students in the UK (M = 9.91, 95% CI [9.32, 10.51], SD = 2.67, t(154) = 2.101, p =.037, Cohen’s d = 0.33).

Study 5a
In a separate pre-test conducted with the same participant pool, we ensured that all snacks were similarly well-liked (average liking ranged between 3.38 for Ritz™ Cheese Cracker Sandwiches™ to 4.87 for Oreo™ Cookies on a scale from 1 to 7, see Supplementary Materials).
From the SUPPLEMENTARY: 
A separate sample of 79 participants from the same pool as the original study rated how much they would like to receive a $50 hamper of each of the fourteen snacks (How much would you like to receive a gift hamper of [snack] worth $50?) on a 7-point scale from not at all to extremely. Average liking scores ranged between 3.38 to 4.87. Detailed results are reported in Table S7 below. 
As the snack options (e.g., Chips Ahoy, Ritz crackers, Doritos) were common in the US but might or might not be common in other countries, we excluded 12 participants who were not born in the US in the analysis reported in the manuscript. We conducted an additional regression without excluding non-US born participants from the dataset and found that the pattern of results did not change. Specifically, the number of attributes participants chose for a good snack (i.e., the breadth of normative standard) was positively correlated with the number of snack options they chose to view, despite the salient reduction in the hamper value with each additional option they chose to view (r = .14, 95% CI [-.004, .28], p = .057). 
We would also like to note that we paused data collection for about two weeks for Thanksgiving as students traveled out of state to visit their families.

Here, we demonstrated that this advantage incurs a cost in metacognitive accuracy (confidence), generating a cognition/metacognition trade-off. Using computational modeling, we found that integration to a fixed boundary results in less variability in evidence integration and thus reduces metacognitive accuracy, compared with a collapsing-boundary or a random-timer strategy. We examined how decision strategy affects metacognitive accuracy in three cross-domain experiments, in which 102 university students completed a free-response session (evidence terminated by the participant’s response) and an interrogation session (fixed number of evidence samples controlled by the experimenter). In both sessions, participants observed a sequence of evidence and reported their choice and confidence. As predicted, the interrogation protocol (preventing integration to boundary) enhanced metacognitive accuracy. We also found that in the free-response sessions, participants integrated evidence to a collapsing boundary—a strategy that achieves an efficient compromise between optimizing choice and metacognitive accuracy. </jats:p>",list(id = "https://openalex.org/T10918", display_name = "Memory Processes and Influences", score = 0.993499994277954, subfield = list(id = "https://openalex.org/subfields/2805", display_name = "Cognitive Neuroscience"), field = list(id = "https://openalex.org/fields/28", display_name = "Neuroscience"), domain = list(id = "https://openalex.org/domains/1", display_name = "Life Sciences")),"Tel Aviv University, Israel","University of California, Riverside, United States","Tel Aviv University, Israel","https://openalex.org/I16391192","Tel Aviv University","education","IL","Israel",NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","https://openalex.org/I103635307","University of California, Riverside","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","https://openalex.org/I16391192","Tel Aviv University","education","IL","Israel",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","10/27/2025 22:07:31","EP","10.1177/09567976211043428","Yes, the article states that there was a pilot study","","No","Yes, the article states that there is a preregistration","3","Empirical study(ies)","Experimental study","The first is a pilot experiment (N = 17), ...

The present study examined how L1 experience moulds the initial processing of foreign (L2) tone during acquisition. In particular, we investigated whether learners were able to rapidly forge new neural memory traces for novel tonal words, which was tracked by recording learners’ ERP responses during two word acquisition sessions. We manipulated the degree of L1–L2 familiarity by comparing learners with a nontonal L1 (German) and a tonal L1 (Swedish) and by using tones that were similar (fall) or dissimilar (high, low, rise) to those occurring in Swedish. Our results indicate that a rapid, pre‐attentive memory trace build‐up for tone manifests in an early ERP component at ~50 ms but only at particularly high levels of L1–L2 similarity. Specifically, early processing was facilitated for an L2 tone that had a familiar pitch shape (fall) and word‐level function (inflection). This underlines the importance of these L1 properties for the early processing of L2 tone. In comparison, a later anterior negativity related to the processing of the tones’ grammatical content was unaffected by native language experience but was instead influenced by lexicality, pitch prominence, entrenchment, and successful learning. Behaviorally, learning effects emerged for all learners and tone types, regardless of L1–L2 familiarity or pitch prominence. Together, the findings suggest that while L1‐based facilitation effects occur, they mainly affect early processing stages and do not necessarily result in more successful L2 acquisition at behavioral level.</jats:p>",list(id = "https://openalex.org/T10465", display_name = "Neurobiology of Language and Bilingualism", score = 0.999599993228912, subfield = list(id = "https://openalex.org/subfields/2805", display_name = "Cognitive Neuroscience"), field = list(id = "https://openalex.org/fields/28", display_name = "Neuroscience"), domain = list(id = "https://openalex.org/domains/1", display_name = "Life Sciences")),"Lund University, Sweden","Lund University, Sweden","Lund University, Sweden","https://openalex.org/I187531555","Lund University","education","SE","Sweden",NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","https://openalex.org/I187531555","Lund University","education","SE","Sweden",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","https://openalex.org/I187531555","Lund University","education","SE","Sweden",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","10/29/2025 7:53:03","RS","10.1111/psyp.14042","Yes, the article states that there was a pilot study","","No","No, there is no statement about preregistration","1","Empirical study(ies)","Experimental study","The pitch movements had a naturalistic pitch span (40 Hz, 6 semitones) compared with the pitch movements of Swedish word tones and were easily distinguished by several native speakers of German and Swedish who piloted the experiment.","“Pilot*” (study, experiment, test or similar; piloting; piloted)","No","One pilot study reported in the article (single study)",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","The pitch movements had a naturalistic pitch span (40 Hz, 6 semitones) compared with the pitch movements of Swedish word tones and were easily distinguished by several native speakers of German and Swedish who piloted the experiment.","supplementary material available but not state pilot data specifically","Supplementary materials hosted by the journal","","No (GO TO NEXT SECTION)","","","No (GO TO NEXT SECTION)","","","Yes","The pitch movements had a naturalistic pitch span (40 Hz, 6 semitones) compared with the pitch movements of Swedish word tones and were easily distinguished by several native speakers of German and Swedish who piloted the experiment.","No, there is no statement about combining pilot data or results with the main study sample.",NA,"",NA,"Yes, the statement says that there is no conflict of interest","","No","","10 min"

Here, we proposed that flexible, context-sensitive information search, rather than automatic responses, underlies these divergent effects of time pressure on prosociality. We demonstrated in two preregistered studies ( N = 304 adults from the United States and Canada; Prolific Academic) that different prosocial contexts (i.e., pure altruism vs. cooperation) have distinct effects on information search, driving people to prioritize information differently, particularly under time pressure. Furthermore, these information priorities subsequently influence prosocial choices, accounting for the different effects of time pressure in altruistic and cooperative contexts.

In Study 1, we experimentally manipulated the reported age of unfamiliar technology and found that people evaluate it more favorably when it is described as originating before (vs. after) their birth. In Studies 2 through 4, participants’ age at the time of invention strongly predicts attitudes toward a wide range of real-world technologies. Finally, we found that individual differences in status-quo-based decision-making moderated evaluations of technology. These studies provide insight into how people respond to the rapidly changing technological landscape. </jats:p>",list(id = "https://openalex.org/T10314", display_name = "Social and Intergroup Psychology", score = 0.990800023078918, subfield = list(id = "https://openalex.org/subfields/3312", display_name = "Sociology and Political Science"), field = list(id = "https://openalex.org/fields/33", display_name = "Social Sciences"), domain = list(id = "https://openalex.org/domains/2", display_name = "Social Sciences")),"University of Washington, United States","Belmont University, United States","Southern Methodist University, United States","https://openalex.org/I201448701","University of Washington","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","https://openalex.org/I47500176","Belmont University","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","https://openalex.org/I178169726","Southern Methodist University","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","11/1/2025 20:23:03","CJG","10.1177/09567976221102868","Yes, the article states that there was a pilot study","","No","Yes, the article states that there is a preregistration","4","Empirical study(ies)","Experimental study","In pilot testing, the inflection point (generalized additive-model line of best fit shifting from convex to concave) occurred at 2.28 years of age (see the Supplemental Material at https://osf.io/bxjnr).","“Pilot*” (study, experiment, test or similar; piloting; piloted), ‘pretesting’ also referred to but unclear what this involved (""selected from a list of inventions that people considered important within their lifetimes, according to pretesting.”)","Yes","One pilot study reported in the article (single study)","In pilot testing, the inflection point ... occurred at 2.28 years of age.

                    How do people learn about things that they have never perceived or inferred–like molecules, miracles or Marie‐Antoinette? For many thinkers, trust is the answer. Humans rely on communicated information, sometimes even when it contradicts blatantly their firsthand experience. We investigate the early ontogeny of this trust using a non‐verbal search paradigm in four main studies and three supplementary studies (
                    <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>
                     = 208). Infants and toddlers first see where a reward is, and then an informant communicates to them that it is in another location. We use this general experimental set‐up to assess the role of age, informants’ knowledge, cue's familiarity, and communicative context on trust in communicated information. Results reveal that infants and toddlers quickly trust familiar and novel communicative cues from well‐informed adults. When searching for the reward, they follow a well‐informed adults’ communicative cue, even when it contradicts what they just saw. Furthermore, infants are less likely to be guided by familiar and novel cues from poorly informed adults than toddlers. Thus, reliance on communication is calibrated during early childhood, up to the point of overriding evidence about informants’ knowledge. Moreover, toddlers trust much more strongly a novel cue when it is used in a communicative manner. Toddlers’ trust cannot be explained by mere compliance: it is highly reduced when communicated information is pitted against what participants currently see. Thus, humans’ strong tendency to rely on familiar and novel communicative cues emerges in infancy, and intensifies during the second year of life.

(Authors, 2021). In the pilot study, the primary image set consisted of original images depicting diverse nature and urban scenes from Germany (100 each), as well as their phase-scrambled and line drawing version. From this larger set, we selected 60 images each for nature and urban environments. Stimuli selection was based on restorativeness (‘How restorative is this image for you?’; 5-point scale ranging from ‘not at all’ to ‘entirely’; original images) and recognition ratings (“Do you recognize objects in the image?”; 5-point scale ranging from ‘not at all’ to ‘entirely’; line drawings): We chose images with high (nature) or low (urban) restorativeness ratings, and low (urban) and high (nature) recognizability ratings for line drawings. The latter criterion led to a smaller difference in recognizability ratings for line drawings in the image set used in the current study (cf. Authors, 2021). The selected 60 original images per category differed in their restorativeness ratings, M nature = 4.33, SD nature = 0.87, M urban = 1.70, SD urban = 0.90, t(118) = 37.49, p < .001, d = 6.85.

Educational settings often contain contextual elements such as classroom decorations or visual aids to enhance student learning. Despite this, most research examining effects of contextual information on children's learning has only utilized lesson‐irrelevant stimuli. While this research has shown that increased looking to task‐irrelevant information hinders learning, the extent to which looking to lesson‐relevant information can benefit children's learning is unknown. We addressed this question by examining 3‐ to 5‐year‐old children's attention to and learning from lesson‐relevant contextual information. We recorded children's eye movements as they viewed video science lessons while lesson‐relevant and ‐irrelevant images appeared in the periphery. We assessed learning based on improvements in content knowledge following the video lessons and separately measured selective attention skills using the Track‐It task. Children overall spent more time looking at lesson‐relevant versus ‐irrelevant images, and those with more initial knowledge of the lesson topics or more advanced selective attention skills showed increased preferential looking to the relevant images. This increased preferential looking to lesson‐relevant images related to more effective learning during trials in which both relevant and irrelevant images were present. These results suggest that the effects of competing contextual information on early learning depend on the relationship between information content and task goals, as well as children's ability to actively select task‐relevant information from their environment.</jats:p>",list(id = "https://openalex.org/T11605", display_name = "Visual Attention and Saliency Detection", score = 0.991800010204315, subfield = list(id = "https://openalex.org/subfields/1707", display_name = "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"), field = list(id = "https://openalex.org/fields/17", display_name = "Computer Science"), domain = list(id = "https://openalex.org/domains/3", display_name = "Physical Sciences")),"Tulane University, United States","Tulane University, United States","Tulane University, United States","https://openalex.org/I114832834","Tulane University","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","https://openalex.org/I114832834","Tulane University","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","https://openalex.org/I114832834","Tulane University","education","US","United States",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","11/7/2025 21:15:07","IP","10.1111/desc.13237","Yes, the article states that there was a pilot study","","No","No, there is no statement about preregistration","1","Empirical study(ies)","Experimental study","The knowledge assessments included six questions for each lesson topic (24 questions total; Table 1), which we selected based on a pilot study (see Supplementary Materials).

Participants used a button box to respond by pressing a button that corresponded to one of the quadrants on the screen. Button presses were only accepted after participants had heard the entire question. Answer choices remained visible until the participant responded to the question or indicated a desire to skip the question. If participants failed to respond within 4500 ms after the question, the same question repeated every 4500 ms until the participant responded or indicated that they wanted to skip the question. We presented all questions for each lesson topic in a single block until children completed all questions. Topic order was counterbalanced across participants and question order was randomized within each topic.
We selected the six questions from each lesson topic with the lowest accuracy to use in the full experiment. Average accuracy for the selected questions was M = .45 (SD = .13), which was above chance responding (i.e., .25; p < .001) but below ceiling performance. This indicated that the subject matter was not too difficult for children in this age group but ensured that there would be room for improvement after viewing the instructional videos. ","No, there is no statement about combining pilot data or results with the main study sample.","The knowledge assessments included six questions for each lesson topic (24 questions total; Table 1), which we selected based on a pilot study (see Supplementary Materials). We determined lesson duration based on research that used similar video-based lessons (Hanley et al., 2017; Remington et al., 2019) and pilot testing aimed at optimizing the lessons for this age group.","quite a few details were hidden in the supplement.

                    Neural oscillations, or brain rhythms, fluctuate in a manner reflecting ongoing behavior. Whether these fluctuations are instrumental or epiphenomenal to the behavior remains elusive. Attempts to experimentally manipulate neural oscillations exogenously using noninvasive brain stimulation have shown some promise, but difficulty with tailoring stimulation parameters to individuals has hindered progress in this field. We demonstrate here using electroencephalography (EEG) neurofeedback in a brain‐computer interface that human participants (
                    <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
                     = 44) learned over multiple sessions across a 6‐day period to self‐regulate their Beta rhythm (13–20 Hz), either up or down, over the right inferior frontal cortex. Training to downregulate Beta was more effective than training to upregulate Beta. The modulation was evident only during neurofeedback task performance but did not lead to offline alteration of Beta rhythm characteristics at rest, nor to changes in subsequent cognitive behavior. Likewise, a control group (
                    <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
                     = 38) who underwent training to up or downregulate the Alpha rhythm (8–12 Hz) did not exhibit behavioral changes. Although the right frontal Beta rhythm has been repeatedly implicated as a key component of the brain's inhibitory control system, the present data suggest that its manipulation offline prior to cognitive task performance does not result in behavioral change in healthy individuals. Whether this form of neurofeedback training could serve as a useful therapeutic target for disorders with dysfunctional inhibitory control as their basis remains to be tested in a context where performance is abnormally poor and neural dynamics are different.

There was also a significant main effect of Congruency, F(1, 76) = 20.91, p < .001, η2 = .353, with faster RTs to congruent (480 ms) compared to incongruent trials (488 ms). The 3-way interaction between Mask, SIW and Congruency was only close to significance, F(2, 76) = 2.74, p = .071, η2 = .065. However, because it was hypothesized that the SIW would influence the congruency effect in the unconscious condition but not in the conscious condition, this 3-way interaction was further explored.

This showed that the evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis (i.e., the hypothesis that the stimuli were detected by the participants) was only anecdotal for the Small and Medium SIW when the primes were masked.

Overall, summary-statistics-based power analysis produced comparable results with the simulation-based power analysis. In the baseline condition, where cluster size and predictor variance are constant across clusters,
summary-statistics-based power analysis should show very similar power estimates with
simulation-based power analysis. In fact, we saw little discrepancy between the proposed and simulation-based methods in the average power and RMSEs (0.009 – 0.019). Given the general equivalence of the two approaches, the observed discrepancy is likely due to sampling errors in the simulation method. In fact, with 1,000 replications of the simulation-based power analysis, the standard error of a proportion estimate is maximally 0.016 (when true proportion is 0.50).
Critically, the results were robust even under conditions where predictor variance or cluster
size was varied across clusters. On average, both methods showed very similar power estimates, indicating that the proposed method is not biased in a systematic manner. RMSEs are mostly below 0.025, although the discrepancy was slightly larger when both L2 sample size cluster sizes were small and cluster size was varied (maximum = 0.030). In comparison to the baseline condition, RMSEs became larger only by 0 – 0.012. The robustness of the summary-statistics-based power analysis is consistent with the previous observations that cluster size heterogeneity does not have much impact on the statistical power estimates (e.g., van Breukelen et al., 2007).""
""The regression results are summarized in Table 4. To quantify the stability of parameter estimates, we also showed 95% CI (we corrected for the standard errors to take into account the fact that the same hypothetical data produced 9 pairs of power estimates). In
short, the results confirmed the robustness of the summary-statistics-based power analysis for both conditions. For L1 effect, overall discrepancy was very small (for relative power difference, -0.0002 and -0.0009; for absolute power difference, 0.0095 and 0.0098). For both relative difference and absolute difference, none of the predictors had strong effects on the discrepancy. For example, L1 effect size showed a negative effect of -0.0039 on the absolute difference in power in the variant cluster size condition. This means that the absolute power difference between the two power analysis methods increased by 0.00039 when (standardized) L1 effect size is smaller by 0.1.
For L2 effect, overall discrepancy was very small (for relative difference, -0.0008 and -
0.0013; for absolute difference, 0.0117 and 0.0124). None of the predictors had strong effects, although the effects seem to be slightly larger than the L1 effect overall. For example, random intercept SD had a positive effect of β = 0.0125 on relative power difference in the varied cluster variance condition. This means that summary-statistics-based power analysis tended to overestimate the statistical power by 0.00125 when random intercept SD increased by 0.1 (i.e. as large as the SD of errors).
For L12 effect, again, overall discrepancy was very small (for relative power difference,
0.0004 and -0.0004; for absolute power difference, 0.0119 and 0.0146). Most of the predictors did not have strong effects. The biggest effect seems to be that of the standardized L12 effect on relative power difference, which showed β= -0.0543 in the varied cluster size condition. This suggests that summary-statistics-based power analysis tends to underestimate power by 0.00543 in comparison to the simulation-based method when standardized L12 effect size increases by 0.1.""
""Results are reported in Table 5. Overall, despite the adverse condition, the proposed method showed reasonably good performance across different combinations of L2 sample size and cluster size, generally indicating the robustness of the summary-statistics-based power analysis. Of particular interest was the case when L2 sample size was small (i.e. 10). Our two major observations were as follows. First, on average, the proposed
method showed very similar statistical power to the simulation-based power analysis. Second, when L2 sample size was small, RMSE increased up to 0.034 (for L1 effect) to 0.048 (for L12 effect); This was a ~0.02-0.03 increase from the baseline model in Simulation 1. Together, these results demonstrate the robustness of the summary-statistics-based power analysis, even with strong violations of the assumption of equal cluster size, and with the modest violation of the assumption of equal predictor variance. The results also suggest that, when dealing with small sample size data, researchers need to bear in mind the possibility that a power estimate based on the proposed method may not be very accurate (i.e. it is better to oversample to be on a safe side).
In sum, these simulation studies demonstrate the reasonable robustness of the summary-
statistics-based power analysis even when critical statistical assumptions are violated. The
discrepancy between the proposed and simulation-based methods do not seem to be strongly impacted by the nature of the prior data (i.e., true parameters that define hypothetical pilot data). Even under the conditions of unequal within-cluster variance of predictor and cluster size (up to CsV = 0.55-0.56), power estimates by the proposed method did not systematically differ from those by the simulation-based method on average, although RMSE became slightly higher when sample size was small.""","No, there is no statement about combining pilot data or results with the main study sample.",NA,"","This research was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Numbers 18H01102; 18K18696 to KM), F.

Specifically, we tested whether a higher moral obligations account could explain these divergent judgements of prejudice. We hypothesised that advantaged witnesses implicitly ascribe higher social power—and hence, elevated moral obligations—to advantaged (compared to disadvantaged) groups. The resulting differential morality judgements, in turn, lead to divergent attributions of prejudice. Five experiments (total <jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 1063) provided converging evidence for our predictions, although we also obtained evidence for a reverse causal pathway in which perceived prejudice determines morality judgements.

Moreover, our ratings show low correlations with concreteness ratings, suggesting that the variables Specificity and Concreteness capture two separate aspects involved in abstraction and that specificity may need to be controlled for when investigating conceptual concreteness.

We did the same with the support for gender diversification efforts scale in a separate regression analysis. We report the full results tables for each model in Table A2. We tested the form of each significant interaction to determine at what values of the moderator (endorsed value or gender diversity support) there was a significant positive relationship between trait gender stereotypicality and trait importance, indicating a masculine prototype, and a weak or non-significant relationship, indicating a balanced prototype.
Looking at the total sample, and consistent with the findings of Danbold & Bendersky (2020), we observed a significant positive relationship between trait gender stereotypicality and trait importance such that, on average, our respondents rated stereotypically masculine traits as more important than stereotypically feminine traits (B = 0.24, 95% Confidence Interval = [0.14, 0.34], p < .001, η2 = 0.02). This is consistent with our prediction that, at baseline, fire service professionals hold a masculine (as opposed to a balanced) professional prototype.
Endorsement of all of the three values we identified a priori as likely associated with holding a balanced prototype significantly moderated the association between trait gender stereotypicality and trait importance. As predicted, both the endorsement of inclusion (interaction term: B = -.25, [-0.36, -0.14], p < .001, η2p = 0.02) and the endorsement of tolerance (interaction term: B = -.17, [-0.26, -0.09], p < .001, η2p = 0.02) significantly attenuated the positive relationship between trait gender stereotypicality and trait importance. Also, as expected, the endorsement of tradition significantly moderated that association, but in the opposite direction (interaction term: B = .07, [0.01, 0.14], p = .022, η2p < 0.01). There was no significant interaction between trait gender stereotypicality and endorsement of any other value. In addition to these three values, support for gender diversity efforts significantly moderated the effect of trait gender stereotypicality on trait importance (interaction term: B = -0.16, [-0.22, -0.10], p < .001, η2p < 0.02).
To better understand the patterns of the significant interactions, we conducted a series of simple slope analyses to identify at which levels of value endorsement and support for gender diversity efforts participants held a balanced or a masculine prototype. Because most of the value endorsement ratings were positively skewed (the median scores for inclusion and tolerance were 6 and the median score for tradition was 5), we examined the slope of the relationship between trait gender stereotypicality and trait importance at more meaningful, specific levels of the moderators rather than at ± 1 SD from the mean (Dawson, 2014). Based on the scale anchors, we coded ratings of 3 as low, 5 as medium, and 7 as high. As can be seen in Figure A1, we observed a balanced prototype (i.e., a null relationship between trait gender stereotypicality and importance) when endorsement of inclusion was high (B = .03, SE = .07, p = .643), endorsement of tolerance was high (B = .06, SE = .07, p = .359), when support for gender diversity efforts was high (B = -.13, SE = .10, p = .162), and when endorsement of tradition was low (B = .09, SE = .08, p = .251). We observed a masculine prototype (i.e., a significant and positive relationship between trait gender stereotypicality and importance) when endorsement of inclusion was low (B = 1.04, SE = .18, p < .001), when endorsement of tolerance was low (B = .75, SE = .13, p < .001), when support for gender diversity efforts was low (B = .52, SE = .07, p < .001), and when endorsement of tradition was high (B = .40, SE = .08, p < .001).

However, not all visual memories extend in this way, which suggests that this process depends on specific scene properties. What factors determine when visual memories will include details that go beyond perceptual experience? Here, seven experiments ( N = 1,100 adults) explored whether spatial scale—specifically, perceived viewing distance—drives boundary extension. We created fake miniatures by exploiting tilt shift, a photographic effect that selectively reduces perceived distance while preserving other scene properties (e.g., making a distant railway appear like a model train). Fake miniaturization increased boundary extension for otherwise identical scenes: Participants who performed a scene-memory task misremembered fake-miniaturized views as farther away than they actually were. This effect went beyond low-level image changes and generalized to a completely different distance manipulation.

This work became the foundation for the theoretical framework by which we assume that infants are able to learn abstract representations and generalize linguistic rules. While some extensions on the original work have shown evidence of rule learning, the outcomes are mixed, and an exact replication of Marcus et al.'s study has thus far not been reported. A
recent meta‐analysis by Rabagliati and colleagues brings to light that the rule‐learning effect depends on stimulus type (e.g., meaningfulness, speech vs. nonspeech) and is not as robust as often assumed. In light of the theoretical importance of the issue at stake, it is appropriate and necessary to assess the replicability and robustness of Marcus et al.'s findings. Here we have undertaken a replication across four labs with a large sample of 7‐month‐old infants (<jats:italic>N </jats:italic>= 96), using the same exposure patterns (ABA and ABB), methodology (Headturn Preference Paradigm), and original stimuli. As in the original study, we tested the hypothesis that infants are able to learn abstract “algebraic” rules and apply them to novel input.

However, little attention has been paid to the question of whether the frequently used experimental paradigms hold adequate psychometric properties. The present study examined the psychometric properties of three widely used cognitive bias tasks: the Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT), the visual dot-probe-task, and the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Approach, attentional, and association biases towards valenced stimuli were repeatedly measured at five different time points in a sample of 79 healthy young adults. Two different devices were used for assessment: a personal computer (PC) and a touchscreen-based tablet. Reliability estimates included internal consistency and temporal stability. Validity was inferred from convergence across different behavioral tasks and correlations between bias scores and self-reported psychological traits. Reliability ranged widely amongst tasks, assessment devices, and measurement time points. While the dot-probe-task appeared to be completely unreliable, bias scores obtained from the PC-based version of the AAT and both (PC and touchscreen) versions of the IAT showed moderate reliability. Almost no associations were found across information processing tasks or between implicit and explicit measures. Cognitive bias research should adopt a standard practice to routinely estimate and report psychometric properties of experimental paradigms, investigate feasible ways to develop more reliable tools, and use tasks that are suitable to answer the precise research question asked.</jats:p>",list(id = "https://openalex.org/T10853", display_name = "Anxiety, Depression, Psychometrics, Treatment, Cognitive Processes", score = 0.999400019645691, subfield = list(id = "https://openalex.org/subfields/3205", display_name = "Experimental and Cognitive Psychology"), field = list(id = "https://openalex.org/fields/32", display_name = "Psychology"), domain = list(id = "https://openalex.org/domains/2", display_name = "Social Sciences")),"University of Siegen, Germany","University of Siegen, Germany","University of Siegen, Germany","https://openalex.org/I206895457","University of Siegen","education","DE","Germany",NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","https://openalex.org/I206895457","University of Siegen","education","DE","Germany",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","https://openalex.org/I206895457","University of Siegen","education","DE","Germany",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","11/17/2025 15:14:04","JB","10.3758/s13428-022-01804-9","Yes, the article states that there was a pilot study","","No","There is a statement that there was NO preregistration.","1","Empirical study(ies)","Experimental study, Quantitative observational study","Apart from that, a pilot study using stimulus material comparable to the AAT and the dot-probe task yielded poor results.","“Pilot*” (study, experiment, test or similar; piloting; piloted)","No","",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,"No (GO TO NEXT SECTION)","","","No (GO TO NEXT SECTION)","","","No (GO TO NEXT SECTION)","","","Yes","""Apart from that, a pilot study using stimulus material comparable to the AAT and the dot-probe task yielded poor results.""","No, there is no statement about combining pilot data or results with the main study sample.","No, but it is implied that this made them change the stimulus materials in the piloted paradigm (the IAT)","","Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.","Yes, the statement says that there is no conflict of interest","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential competing interest.","No","","5 minutes"

This study reports the perspectives of early intervention providers who learned to use Project ImPACT for Toddlers on whether the intervention was a good fit for their practice and easy to use. The study also examines how many agencies are using Project ImPACT for Toddlers and how many families have received the intervention in the community. The goal of the study is to inform the continued use of Project ImPACT for Toddlers in the community and support offering the intervention in other regions.

                    <jats:p>South Africa's rates of psychiatric morbidity are among the highest in sub‐Saharan Africa and are foregrounded by the country's long history of political violence during apartheid. Growing evidence suggests that in utero stress exposure is a potent developmental risk factor for future mental illness risk, yet the extent to which the psychiatric effects of prenatal stress impact the next generation are unknown. We evaluate the intergenerational effects of prenatal stress experienced during apartheid on psychiatric morbidity among children at ages 17–18 and also assess the moderating effects of maternal age, social support, and past household adversity.</jats:p>

                    <jats:p>Participants come from Birth‐to‐Twenty, a longitudinal birth cohort study in Soweto‐Johannesburg, South Africa's largest peri‐urban township which was the epicentre of violent repression and resistance during the final years of the apartheid regime. Pregnant women were prospectively enrolled in 1990 and completed questionnaires assessing social experiences, and their children's psychiatric morbidity were assessed at ages 17–18.</jats:p>

                    <jats:p>Full data were available from 304 mother–child pairs in 2007–8. Maternal prenatal stress in 1990 was not directly associated greater psychiatric morbidity during at ages 17–18. Maternal age and past household adversity moderated the intergenerational mental health effects of prenatal stress such that children born to younger mothers and late adolescent/young adult children experiencing greater household adversity exhibited worse psychiatric morbidity at ages 17–18. Social support did not buffer against the long‐term psychiatric impacts of prenatal stress.</jats:p>

                    <jats:p>Greater prenatal stress from apartheid predicted adverse psychiatric outcomes among children born to younger mothers and adolescents/young adults who experienced greater concurrent stress. Our findings suggest that prenatal stress may affect adolescent mental health, have stress‐sensitising effects, and represent possible intergenerational effects of trauma experienced under apartheid in this sample.</jats:p>

However, the empirical support for these hypotheses is limited by inconsistencies in the way socialness has been defined and measured. To further advance theory, the field must establish a clearer working definition, and research efforts could be facilitated by the availability of an extensive set of socialness ratings for individual concepts. Therefore, in the current work, we employed a novel and inclusive definition to test the extent to which socialness is reliably perceived as a broad construct, and we report socialness norms for over 8000 English words, including nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Our inclusive socialness measure shows good reliability and validity, and our analyses suggest that the socialness ratings capture aspects of word meaning which are distinct to those measured by other pertinent semantic constructs, including concreteness and emotional valence. Finally, in a series of regression analyses, we show for the first time that the socialness of a word's meaning explains unique variance in participant performance on lexical tasks. Our dataset of socialness norms has considerable item overlap with those used in both other lexical/semantic norms and in available behavioural mega-studies. They can help target testable predictions about brain and behaviour derived from multiple representation theories and neurobiological accounts of social semantics.</jats:p>",list(id = "https://openalex.org/T11431", display_name = "Action Observation and Synchronization", score = 0.999100029468536, subfield = list(id = "https://openalex.org/subfields/3207", display_name = "Social Psychology"), field = list(id = "https://openalex.org/fields/32", display_name = "Psychology"), domain = list(id = "https://openalex.org/domains/2", display_name = "Social Sciences")),"Bangor University, United Kingdom","Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital, Canada","Bangor University, United Kingdom","https://openalex.org/I161548249","Bangor University","education","GB","United Kingdom",NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","https://openalex.org/I1292859797","Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital","healthcare","CA","Canada",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","https://openalex.org/I161548249","Bangor University","education","GB","United Kingdom",NA,NA,NA,NA,"author-profile","11/21/2025 12:05:06","JH","10.3758/s13428-022-01810-x","Yes, the article states that there was a pilot study","","No","The article states, the study was not pre-registered.","1","Empirical study(ies)","Quantitative observational study","We used 30 of the 8948 words as a set of control items which were to be presented to every participant and used during the data cleaning process (see below).
