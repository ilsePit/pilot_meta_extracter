We first conducted a pilot study to create the lists of criteria to be presented to participants across different domains. Please see Supplementary Materials for the Pilot Study. FROM THE SUPPLEMENTARY: Pilot study
We conducted a pilot study to create lists of criteria in four different domains to use in subsequent studies. We posted a study for 400 US participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk. In response, 438 participants (M¬age¬ = 34.98 years; 214 women, 113 men, one other, and 110 unreported) completed the study. We asked the participants to describe the criteria considered mandatory in their society for five different normative standards —a good employee, a good parent, the perfect job, the perfect house, and a beautiful woman. For example, in the employee domain, we asked participants, “Please write down the mandatory qualities an employee should possess to be considered a good employee in your society.” For each question, participants could list as many criteria as they wished.

To identify the most common criteria that participants mentioned for each domain, we submitted all criteria that participants listed in each domain to a latent semantic analysis (Landauer & Dumais, 1997). Specifically, for each domain, we entered all criteria listed by all participants on lsa.colorado.edu, which gave us a list of 100 criteria that were closest in meaning to all the criteria entered. Based on this analysis, we created lists of criteria for each domain to use in the subsequent studies.

Study 2b
Pre-Test. We conducted a pre-test to test the assumption that Singaporean consumers have broader normative standards for body washes compared with UK consumers. Given that women are the primary shoppers for household products both in the UK (Statista, 2014) and in Singapore (Nielsen, 2020), we sampled women in this study. We recruited 76 women students (Mage = 23.81) from a large public university in Singapore, and 80 women students from the UK through Prolific Academic™ (Mage = 21.53 years). We presented participants
with a list of 15 criteria that body washes can satisfy (e.g., be moisturizing, be cruelty-free, be dermatologist-approved), and asked them to select the benefits that were required for a body wash to be considered a good body wash. As in Study 1b, for each criterion, participants were asked to select either Yes or No. An independent samples t-test found that
students in Singapore indicated that a good body wash needs to meet more criteria (M = 10.74, 95% CI [10.24, 11.24], SD = 2.19) than did students in the UK (M = 9.91, 95% CI [9.32, 10.51], SD = 2.67, t(154) = 2.101, p =.037, Cohen’s d = 0.33).

Study 5a
In a separate pre-test conducted with the same participant pool, we ensured that all snacks were similarly well-liked (average liking ranged between 3.38 for Ritz™ Cheese Cracker Sandwiches™ to 4.87 for Oreo™ Cookies on a scale from 1 to 7, see Supplementary Materials).
From the SUPPLEMENTARY: 
A separate sample of 79 participants from the same pool as the original study rated how much they would like to receive a $50 hamper of each of the fourteen snacks (How much would you like to receive a gift hamper of [snack] worth $50?) on a 7-point scale from not at all to extremely. Average liking scores ranged between 3.38 to 4.87. Detailed results are reported in Table S7 below. 
As the snack options (e.g., Chips Ahoy, Ritz crackers, Doritos) were common in the US but might or might not be common in other countries, we excluded 12 participants who were not born in the US in the analysis reported in the manuscript. We conducted an additional regression without excluding non-US born participants from the dataset and found that the pattern of results did not change. Specifically, the number of attributes participants chose for a good snack (i.e., the breadth of normative standard) was positively correlated with the number of snack options they chose to view, despite the salient reduction in the hamper value with each additional option they chose to view (r = .14, 95% CI [-.004, .28], p = .057). 
We would also like to note that we paused data collection for about two weeks for Thanksgiving as students traveled out of state to visit their families.

Initial survey items were created to measure awareness of self-objectification and objectification by others. Survey items gauge thedegree to which this cognizance relates to behavior (e.g., throughrestricted eating or attempts to alter one's appearance through exer-cise or “self-care” techniques). The 63 items were developed basedon a thorough literature review and in response to perceived gaps inexisting self-objectification questionnaires.

(Authors, 2021). In the pilot study, the primary image set consisted of original images depicting diverse nature and urban scenes from Germany (100 each), as well as their phase-scrambled and line drawing version. From this larger set, we selected 60 images each for nature and urban environments. Stimuli selection was based on restorativeness (‘How restorative is this image for you?’; 5-point scale ranging from ‘not at all’ to ‘entirely’; original images) and recognition ratings (“Do you recognize objects in the image?”; 5-point scale ranging from ‘not at all’ to ‘entirely’; line drawings): We chose images with high (nature) or low (urban) restorativeness ratings, and low (urban) and high (nature) recognizability ratings for line drawings. The latter criterion led to a smaller difference in recognizability ratings for line drawings in the image set used in the current study (cf. Authors, 2021). The selected 60 original images per category differed in their restorativeness ratings, M nature = 4.33, SD nature = 0.87, M urban = 1.70, SD urban = 0.90, t(118) = 37.49, p < .001, d = 6.85.

Based on parental report, 70.1% of participants were Caucasian, 13.8% were Black, 12.3% were Multiracial, and 3.1% were Asian. 4.6% of these participants also identified as Hispanic. Participants were excluded if they had any diagnosed developmental, neurological, or visual conditions. These participants received a $10 gift card after completing the pilot study.
Participants answered 12 content knowledge questions about each lesson topic (How Frogs Grow, How Plants Grow, How Energy is Made, Where Animals Live). The procedure was identical to the baseline knowledge assessment described in the main experiment. During each trial participants heard a question spoken verbally while images representing the response choices appeared in each quadrant of the screen. Participants used a button box to respond by pressing a button that corresponded to one of the quadrants on the screen. Button presses were only accepted after participants had heard the entire question. Answer choices remained visible until the participant responded to the question or indicated a desire to skip the question. If participants failed to respond within 4500 ms after the question, the same question repeated every 4500 ms until the participant responded or indicated that they wanted to skip the question. We presented all questions for each lesson topic in a single block until children completed all questions. Topic order was counterbalanced across participants and question order was randomized within each topic.
We selected the six questions from each lesson topic with the lowest accuracy to use in the full experiment. Average accuracy for the selected questions was M = .45 (SD = .13), which was above chance responding (i.e., .25; p < .001) but below ceiling performance.

Overall, summary-statistics-based power analysis produced comparable results with the simulation-based power analysis. In the baseline condition, where cluster size and predictor variance are constant across clusters,
summary-statistics-based power analysis should show very similar power estimates with
simulation-based power analysis. In fact, we saw little discrepancy between the proposed and simulation-based methods in the average power and RMSEs (0.009 – 0.019). Given the general equivalence of the two approaches, the observed discrepancy is likely due to sampling errors in the simulation method. In fact, with 1,000 replications of the simulation-based power analysis, the standard error of a proportion estimate is maximally 0.016 (when true proportion is 0.50).
Critically, the results were robust even under conditions where predictor variance or cluster
size was varied across clusters. On average, both methods showed very similar power estimates, indicating that the proposed method is not biased in a systematic manner. RMSEs are mostly below 0.025, although the discrepancy was slightly larger when both L2 sample size cluster sizes were small and cluster size was varied (maximum = 0.030). In comparison to the baseline condition, RMSEs became larger only by 0 – 0.012. The robustness of the summary-statistics-based power analysis is consistent with the previous observations that cluster size heterogeneity does not have much impact on the statistical power estimates (e.g., van Breukelen et al., 2007).""
""The regression results are summarized in Table 4. To quantify the stability of parameter estimates, we also showed 95% CI (we corrected for the standard errors to take into account the fact that the same hypothetical data produced 9 pairs of power estimates). In
short, the results confirmed the robustness of the summary-statistics-based power analysis for both conditions. For L1 effect, overall discrepancy was very small (for relative power difference, -0.0002 and -0.0009; for absolute power difference, 0.0095 and 0.0098). For both relative difference and absolute difference, none of the predictors had strong effects on the discrepancy. For example, L1 effect size showed a negative effect of -0.0039 on the absolute difference in power in the variant cluster size condition. This means that the absolute power difference between the two power analysis methods increased by 0.00039 when (standardized) L1 effect size is smaller by 0.1.
For L2 effect, overall discrepancy was very small (for relative difference, -0.0008 and -
0.0013; for absolute difference, 0.0117 and 0.0124). None of the predictors had strong effects, although the effects seem to be slightly larger than the L1 effect overall. For example, random intercept SD had a positive effect of β = 0.0125 on relative power difference in the varied cluster variance condition. This means that summary-statistics-based power analysis tended to overestimate the statistical power by 0.00125 when random intercept SD increased by 0.1 (i.e. as large as the SD of errors).
For L12 effect, again, overall discrepancy was very small (for relative power difference,
0.0004 and -0.0004; for absolute power difference, 0.0119 and 0.0146). Most of the predictors did not have strong effects. The biggest effect seems to be that of the standardized L12 effect on relative power difference, which showed β= -0.0543 in the varied cluster size condition. This suggests that summary-statistics-based power analysis tends to underestimate power by 0.00543 in comparison to the simulation-based method when standardized L12 effect size increases by 0.1.""
""Results are reported in Table 5. Overall, despite the adverse condition, the proposed method showed reasonably good performance across different combinations of L2 sample size and cluster size, generally indicating the robustness of the summary-statistics-based power analysis. Of particular interest was the case when L2 sample size was small (i.e. 10). Our two major observations were as follows. First, on average, the proposed
method showed very similar statistical power to the simulation-based power analysis. Second, when L2 sample size was small, RMSE increased up to 0.034 (for L1 effect) to 0.048 (for L12 effect); This was a ~0.02-0.03 increase from the baseline model in Simulation 1. Together, these results demonstrate the robustness of the summary-statistics-based power analysis, even with strong violations of the assumption of equal cluster size, and with the modest violation of the assumption of equal predictor variance. The results also suggest that, when dealing with small sample size data, researchers need to bear in mind the possibility that a power estimate based on the proposed method may not be very accurate (i.e. it is better to oversample to be on a safe side).
In sum, these simulation studies demonstrate the reasonable robustness of the summary-
statistics-based power analysis even when critical statistical assumptions are violated. The
discrepancy between the proposed and simulation-based methods do not seem to be strongly impacted by the nature of the prior data (i.e., true parameters that define hypothetical pilot data). Even under the conditions of unequal within-cluster variance of predictor and cluster size (up to CsV = 0.55-0.56), power estimates by the proposed method did not systematically differ from those by the simulation-based method on average, although RMSE became slightly higher when sample size was small.""","No, there is no statement about combining pilot data or results with the main study sample.",NA,,"This research was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Numbers 18H01102; 18K18696 to KM), F.

realized that, to empirically look at accuracy of predictions about such task-related and interpersonal contextual performance in the team, we should not use the MBA videos and impose upon such putative job in a noisy and unrealistic manner but would instead have to create new stimuli in which participants actually engage in a task that requires low or high task interdependence (as in Study 2).

Pilot Field Study (section header).
This pilot study confirms our definition of sexist supervisors as holding masculine professional prototypes.","“Pilot*” (study, experiment, test or similar; piloting; piloted)",Yes,One pilot study reported in the article (single study),"Before testing our hypotheses, we surveyed 76 fire service professionals in supervisory positions to test our assumption that sexist supervisors hold masculine professional prototypes.",NA,we surveyed 76 fire service professionals in supervisory positions.,NA,NA,NA,,NA,No (GO TO NEXT SECTION),,,No (GO TO NEXT SECTION),,,Yes,Supplementary materials hosted by the journal,Yes,Yes,"To determine the degree to which supervisors at different levels of endorsed values held a masculine or balanced prototype, we regressed trait importance (i.e., how essential traits are to the prototype) on the interaction between trait gender stereotypicality (i.e., the gender stereotypicality rating of each trait, with higher values indicating more masculine) and, in separate models, each endorsed value. We did the same with the support for gender diversification efforts scale in a separate regression analysis. We report the full results tables for each model in Table A2. We tested the form of each significant interaction to determine at what values of the moderator (endorsed value or gender diversity support) there was a significant positive relationship between trait gender stereotypicality and trait importance, indicating a masculine prototype, and a weak or non-significant relationship, indicating a balanced prototype.
Looking at the total sample, and consistent with the findings of Danbold & Bendersky (2020), we observed a significant positive relationship between trait gender stereotypicality and trait importance such that, on average, our respondents rated stereotypically masculine traits as more important than stereotypically feminine traits (B = 0.24, 95% Confidence Interval = [0.14, 0.34], p < .001, η2 = 0.02). This is consistent with our prediction that, at baseline, fire service professionals hold a masculine (as opposed to a balanced) professional prototype.
Endorsement of all of the three values we identified a priori as likely associated with holding a balanced prototype significantly moderated the association between trait gender stereotypicality and trait importance. As predicted, both the endorsement of inclusion (interaction term: B = -.25, [-0.36, -0.14], p < .001, η2p = 0.02) and the endorsement of tolerance (interaction term: B = -.17, [-0.26, -0.09], p < .001, η2p = 0.02) significantly attenuated the positive relationship between trait gender stereotypicality and trait importance. Also, as expected, the endorsement of tradition significantly moderated that association, but in the opposite direction (interaction term: B = .07, [0.01, 0.14], p = .022, η2p < 0.01). There was no significant interaction between trait gender stereotypicality and endorsement of any other value. In addition to these three values, support for gender diversity efforts significantly moderated the effect of trait gender stereotypicality on trait importance (interaction term: B = -0.16, [-0.22, -0.10], p < .001, η2p < 0.02).
To better understand the patterns of the significant interactions, we conducted a series of simple slope analyses to identify at which levels of value endorsement and support for gender diversity efforts participants held a balanced or a masculine prototype. Because most of the value endorsement ratings were positively skewed (the median scores for inclusion and tolerance were 6 and the median score for tradition was 5), we examined the slope of the relationship between trait gender stereotypicality and trait importance at more meaningful, specific levels of the moderators rather than at ± 1 SD from the mean (Dawson, 2014). Based on the scale anchors, we coded ratings of 3 as low, 5 as medium, and 7 as high. As can be seen in Figure A1, we observed a balanced prototype (i.e., a null relationship between trait gender stereotypicality and importance) when endorsement of inclusion was high (B = .03, SE = .07, p = .643), endorsement of tolerance was high (B = .06, SE = .07, p = .359), when support for gender diversity efforts was high (B = -.13, SE = .10, p = .162), and when endorsement of tradition was low (B = .09, SE = .08, p = .251). We observed a masculine prototype (i.e., a significant and positive relationship between trait gender stereotypicality and importance) when endorsement of inclusion was low (B = 1.04, SE = .18, p < .001), when endorsement of tolerance was low (B = .75, SE = .13, p < .001), when support for gender diversity efforts was low (B = .52, SE = .07, p < .001), and when endorsement of tradition was high (B = .40, SE = .08, p < .001).

In addition, each participant was presented with the 20 control words, which were randomly distributed throughout their list.","“Pilot*” (study, experiment, test or similar; piloting; piloted)",Yes,One pilot study reported in the article (single study),to ensure high-quality data,NA,39 parents,NA,we recruited 39 parents whose child was participating in an unrelated study,NA,,NA,No (GO TO NEXT SECTION),,,No (GO TO NEXT SECTION),,,No (GO TO NEXT SECTION),,,Yes,The current Child BOI ratings were strongly correlated with the ratings collected for the same words in the pilot study (r = 0.93).,Data from the pilot was used to inform validity of main study data.,"The resulting norms have good validity, strongly correlating with Child BOI ratings from a pilot study conducted prior to this study",,"This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), in the form of a Postgraduate Scholarship - Doctoral to EJM and a Discovery Grant to PMP.","Yes, the statement says that there is no conflict of interest",,No,,15

These words were selected based on the ratings received in a pilot study (N = 36 participants) that was run to obtain an initial assessment of whether participants understand the task instructions and, in particular, the description of the inclusive socialness measure, and whether they provide reliable ratings (for a detailed description, see Section S1 of Supplementary Materials). Control words were selected to vary in the mean pilot socialness ratings, as well as in their concreteness (Brysbaert et al., 2014) and valence ratings (Warriner et al., 2013).","“Pilot*” (study, experiment, test or similar; piloting; piloted)",Yes,One pilot study reported in the article (single study),Control words were selected to vary in the mean pilot socialness ratings,NA,36,NA,"Participants were

instructions moderately well, 55.56% very well and 36.11% extremely well. Most
participants provided explanations that were consistent with our inclusive socialness
definition (e.g.: “Socialness describes anything related to people, for instance their
interactions, ways of describing people, relationships, social places/event, social beliefs,
etc.”; “relation to people and society”). Interestingly, many participants focused their
explanations on the link between the word’s meaning and social interactions (e.g., “Of, or
relating to, the interaction of individuals. That which pertains to people interacting.”; “The
socialness referred to how likely it was that the words were associated with social concepts
by involving social interactions, by influencing social interactions, and by representing those
and the values of those in social encounters.”). 

A Pearson’s Chi-square test of independence suggested that self-reported
understanding of the instructions did not depend on the version of the instructions χ² (2, N =
36) = 0.92, p = 0.63. There was a strong positive correlation between mean socialness scores
for the two instruction versions (r = 0.93, p <.001, R
2 = 0.87). Moreover, the reliability was
comparable for the two versions, with a mean Spearman-Brown corrected split-half reliability
of 0.93 (SD = 0.15) for version 1 and 0.95 (SD = 0.12) for version 2 (across 100 random
splits). Therefore, we concluded that the wording did not significantly influence raters’
responses.","Yes, only the results (pilot results were used or combined with the main study results to support final conclusions)."," Therefore, we concluded that the wording did not significantly influence raters’
